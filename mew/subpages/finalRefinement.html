    <h2>Bubble App: Redefining Social Connections for Young Professionals</h2>
    <p>
      The Bubble App is a mobile app that fosters building platonic
      relationships through shared community experiences, catering towards young
      professionals relocating to new and unfamiliar cities. The app’s intuitive
      design offers three views for event browsing - a personalized and
      aesthetic Bubble view, a location-centric Map view, and an
      information-focused List view, appealing to a diverse set of user needs
      and preferences.
    </p>

    <p>Figure 1: App Logo</p>
    <p>
      The user’s journey through the app transitions from exploring to attending
      events by allowing users to bookmark, join group chats, and RVSP to
      events. User authentication ensures privacy, with limited profile data
      displayed to other users. The app also aims to support the development of
      meaningful connections by encouraging users to attend events and engage in
      conversations through the chat feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Refining Brilliance: Crafting the Design Path</h2>
    <p>
      During the Figma final design phase, our focus centered on organizing key
      high-level elements such as the main page, event page, and chats. We
      wanted to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly interface. Iterative
      refinement involving user tests allowed us to crystallize our vision while
      trimming down the list of potential features for a more focused app.
    </p>

    <h3>
      1. Response to Paper Prototyping User Feedback for Heuristic Evaluation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Users responded positively to the use of bubbles for displaying events in
      our Bubble app. The bubble interface was described as “fun” and appealing
      to interact with. While this approach resonated well with the majority of
      users, a subset expressed a desire for alternative views to explore events
      further. Specifically, some users suggested considering a map view or a
      calendar view as alternative options. We considered user feedback and
      integrated a map view into our events page design and a calendar on the
      navigation bar to view all the events after saving them. Incorporating
      both the map view and a calendar offered a more valuable way to engage
      with the events.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Responses to Team-Internal Deliberations</h3>
    <p>
      In our previous phrase, navigating event details and chats prompted
      discussion on optimal access – considering a dedicated button or linking
      through the profile screen. We also explored bubble-inspired designs for
      group chat access, with a format resembling Instagram’s Highlights (Figure
      2). The inclusion of a map feature sparked discussion on necessity and
      placement, leading to considerations like a map icon in the navigation bar
      or a toggle between bubble and map views. For aesthetics, a survey among
      potential users revealed a sleek blue and purple theme as the favored
      color scheme. Recognizing the importance of user customization, filters
      were identified as crucial for tailoring events based on specific
      criteria, such as locations, activity types, and age requirements.

      (right)
    </p>

    <h3>3. Responses to A/B Testing</h3>
    <p>
      After creating a formal usability plan and testing it with users, there
      were common themes:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Map view: Users appreciate the map view for gauging event proximity but
      desire clearer location indicators and a legend for color coding. Some
      find it less intuitive than the list view.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. List view: Generally favored for its clarity and comprehensive display
      of information. Users appreciate its organization and straightforward
      presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Bubble View: Seen as aesthetically pleasing but questioned for its
      practicality, with suggestions to include more event details without
      compromising aesthetics. Some find it engaging but not as informative as
      the list view.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Icons and Buttons: Some confusion was noted, particularly with the RSVP
      and bookmark icons, suggesting the need for clearer signifiers or
      tooltips.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Filtering and Searching: Users generally appreciate the functionality
      but, in some cases, overlook icons on the bubble view.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the overall takeaway from user feedback on our design was the
      aesthetic appeal of the Bubble view. The visually engaging nature of this
      interface element was widely acknowledged, yet users also expressed a
      collective desire for more detailed event information within the Bubble
      view to enhance its practical utility. Clarity and intuitive design
      emerged as the most important considerations, particularly in the realm of
      icons and buttons, where users highlighted a need for clear signifiers and
      tooltips to resolve confusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another noteworthy observation was the variance in user preferences
      regarding the default screen arrangement. While some users favored the
      Bubble in the middle for its perceived centrality, others leaned towards
      having it on the left, highlighting the importance of catering to diverse
      user expectations in interface design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, users consistently placed value on comprehensive information,
      particularly within the List view. Its organizational structure and
      ability to present detailed information upfront resonated positively with
      users. Simultaneously, the Map view earned appreciation for its visual
      representation of event locations, emphasizing its contribution to the
      overall user experience. These insights collectively underscored the
      nuanced balance required between aesthetics, functionality, and user
      preferences in refining the List-Bubble-Map interface for an optimized and
      user-centric design.
    </p>

    <h2>Event Browsing</h2>
    <p>
      The event browsing page marks the start of the main flow of the app, as
      the first screen that is displayed to the user upon loading into the app
      (Figure 3). It consists of three different UIs, which can be navigated
      through with toggle buttons at the top of the screen. Each UI caters to a
      different set of needs and desires that we found our users expressed.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/final_report/bubble_view.jpg"
      alt="Bubble View"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>Figure 3: The Bubble view for event browsing</p>
    <p>
      With the current design, the Bubble view is the default event-browsing
      view that users will first see upon opening the app (Figure 3). As a
      landing page of the entire app, it tied the app’s bubble-themed brand into
      an aesthetic and functional way to focus on events appealing to the user’s
      personal interests. Events meeting the criteria specified in the filters
      are displayed with random colors and in a random order within the screen.
      The size of the bubble conveys important information: a larger bubble size
      indicates more of an alignment between the event and the user’s predicted
      interests. As a stylistic feature of this UI, the bubbles slowly and idly
      scroll toward the top of the screen when left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bubble view, “filter” and “search” buttons were implemented to
      further customize and streamline a user’s event browsing experience
      (Figure 4). However, when tested by users, these two buttons frequently
      fell under the radar. Only once the buttons were explicitly pointed out to
      them were many of the usability testers able to recognize their value. In
      response to this, many testers expressed wishes to make the buttons more
      obvious to a first-time user. This highlighted an important issue with the
      design of these buttons, especially when comparing them to the
      effectiveness of similar buttons in the List view (Figure 5). Likely the
      List view’s layout contributed to this; the search bar, sort-by dropdown,
      and filter dropdown all take up quite a lot of space in the vertical
      center of the screen, making them difficult to miss. However, in the
      Bubble view, the search and filter buttons are quite small and on the
      edges of the screen. They’re placed on the sides of the toggle button
      group, which ends up overshadowing the much smaller, less colorful icons.
    </p>

      width="300"
    />
    <p>Figure 5: Search and Filter buttons in the List view</p>
    <p>
      To accompany the Bubble view are 2 alternative views: Map and List, which
      are intended to be secondary to the Bubble view. The Map view contains a
      scrollable map with small bubble markers to indicate where events are
      occurring, but doesn’t initially contain any visible text (Figure 6).
      Therefore, the Map view appeals to users who prioritize event location
      over actual event details, perhaps if traveling was a limiting factor as
      one A/B tester mentioned. Two other testers also expressed that they liked
      seeing things happening around them, which made this view appealing.
      Clicking on a map marker displays a hover card to preview event
      information, and the user can then navigate to the actual Event Details
      screen if the event appeals to them (Figure 6).
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/final_report/map_view.jpg"
      alt="Map View"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>Figure 6: Map View</p>
    <p>
      Originally, the design consisted only of the Bubble and Map views (Figure
      7). After conversations stemming from a heuristic evaluation of the
      prototype, we recognized a desire for a third alternative view that listed
      events and details in a more standard, text-based format. The general
      sentiment was that the Bubble view was a visually pleasing and dynamic
      version of a list, but it was difficult to quickly scan event names due to
      the irregularity of the text placement. Additionally, users wanted to be
      able to efficiently see a lot of the event’s information (date, time,
      location, etc), which wasn’t suitable for the sleek look of the Bubble
      view or the text-free design of the Map view, but was well-suited to a
      standard list format.
    </p>

      alt="Original prototype Bubble View"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>Figure 7: Original prototype with only Bubble and Map views</p>
    <p>
      Overall, the List view fulfills user desires to see a “less graphical”
      layout of events (Figure 8). The design balances displaying plentiful
      information in an easily-parsable format without overwhelming users with
      the amount of text on the screen. Additionally, the search bar and filter
      options are more obvious on this view than other views because this List
      view relies entirely on user input while browsing, instead of algorithm
      recommendations or location.
    </p>

    />

    <h2>Event Browsing: Toggle Buttons</h2>
    <p>
      Within the toggle button group, the Bubble view button is centered to
      enforce its hierarchical position, while emphasizing that the other two
      views are equally valid and useful alternatives. The order of the toggle
      buttons was determined through discussions with usability test
      participants, and a survey sent out to a large population of a similar
      demographic as our target audience of young professionals (18 - 24
      year-olds) (Figure 9).
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/final_report/survey_results.jpg"
      alt="Survey Results about toggle button order"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>Figure 9: Toggle button order survey</p>
    <p>
      Out of the 4 choices, 34% of survey respondents indicated a preference for
      the order “List - Bubble - Toggle”. Having a central Bubble view button
      was significantly more popular; some participants referenced Snapchat as a
      familiar UI, with the default/main view as the center button. From there,
      the ideal order of the List and Map buttons was not so clear-cut based on
      how close the survey results are. However, some of our design usability
      testers offered clear reasons for supporting the List-Bubble-Map order:
      having the List view as the leftmost option felt intuitive due to the
      inherent left alignment of the displayed text in the UI.
    </p>

    <h2>Event Details</h2>
    <p>
      The event details page is what users see when they click on an event in
      any event browsing view. From this page, users can read more information
      about the event and choose to RSVP using the save button. This page is
      fairly one-to-one with our original heuristic testing prototype, as users
      found the layout conducive and the information provided sensible (Figure
      10). During A/B testing, as well, users specifically pointed out that they
      enjoyed seeing the “Who’s Going” list and profile pics of friends around
      the event image.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/final_report/event_details.jpg"
      alt="Event Details page"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>
      Figure 10: Current design (left) compared to original prototype (right)
    </p>
    <p>
      The one point of confusion that users ran into was the RSVP button itself.
      We used the bookmark icon, and depending on the specific word used to ask
      a user to perform the task, they had difficulty realizing the bookmark was
      the button they needed to press. When told to “save” an event, users
      easily identified the bookmark as the correct option. When told to “join”
      an event, the button’s purpose was less obvious. The buttons to add an
      event to calendar and add yourself to an event chat both had icons that
      were clear, but the bookmark with the intention of “mark interest in an
      event” was nebulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if we had developed a profile page where we intended users could
      view the events they bookmarked, the function would be more clear.
      However, for these runs we focused more heavily on the event browsing
      features instead of expanding the technicalities of the joining-event
      options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our future studies might include another round of testing with that
      profile page to gauge user understanding. Alternatively, we might just
      change the bookmark button to a more clarified “Join” or “Save” text
      button, forgoing the aesthetic of icon-only buttons in favor of increased
      user comparability.
    </p>

    <h2>Heuristic Evaluation Response:</h2>
    <p>
      Our violations of severity 3 or higher can be grouped into five different
      categories: User controls, Error handling and prevention, Instruction
      integration, Help and support, and Bug fixes and future features
    </p>
    <h3>User Controls:</h3>
    <p>Two violations addressed user controls:</p>
    <p>
      1. Will there be a way to leave a chat if you no longer want to be
      involved or joined by accident?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Will there be the typical chat features of muting notifications,
      leaving, @-ing someone? Most of these I assume aren’t implemented because
      it’s a prototype but I think this would be important to have so a user has
      control over the chat group feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most chatting interfaces, the Bubble App’s design ensures that users
      have full control over their participation. They will be able to leave
      chats, mute notifications, and @ other users in a chat. Users will also be
      able to un-RSVP and unsave events at any point after joining the
      associated chat; nothing about joining a chat is binding to users.
      Additionally, to make all users feel comfortable with using our app, they
      will be able to block and report other users who make them uncomfortable.
    </p>

    <h3>Error Handling and Prevention:</h3>
    <p>Two violations addressed error handling and prevention:</p>
    <p>
      1. None was included in the current prototype, what happens when people
      try to make an event without a name? Or without participants? How would
      you handle users who are trying to do things with the app that it is not
      supposed to?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. I don’t think there was any error prevention in the prototype but it
      should definitely be implemented. Having checks for giving complete event
      info, leaving chats if added mistakenly, etc should definitely be
      included.
    </p>
    <p>
      To maintain the quality of interactions, the app will not allow events to
      be created without essential information like event name, location, and
      time/date. There will be input validation implemented to prevent
      submitting invalid data. Additionally, users can report inappropriate
      content or behavior, ensuring the community remains aligned with the app’s
      spirit. We’ve addressed the error prevention concerns by implementing
      confirmation dialogs before submitting every destructive or important
      interaction, such as when users RSVP to events, leave chats, delete an
      event, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Instruction Integration:</h3>
    <p>One violation addressed instruction integration:</p>
    <p>
      1. How could you integrate your instructions in such a way that it
      wouldn't be intrusive to a user experience? What other documentation could
      you need? I imagine having instructions for event creation must be
      important
    </p>
    <p>
      We now offer an onboarding tutorial that guides new users through the
      app’s features. The tutorial is non-intrusive and easy to follow along to.
      Additionally, in the future, there will be a button that allows users to
      replay this tutorial at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Help and Support:</h3>
    <p>One violation addressed help and support:</p>
    <p>
      1. I didn’t see a help button but… I don’t think it’s needed at this phase
      of prototyping, especially considering other apps I’ve used will tend to
      keep this information in the settings tab and I don’t think any team is
      focusing on making a settings tab right now
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, we don’t have help buttons integrated in the app. Our future
      design plans involve screens consisting of a lot of data (such as the
      Event Browsing pages) having a small question mark icon in the top right
      corner. Upon clicking this icon, a dialog will appear containing
      information about the current screen’s purpose and behavior. This design
      ensures users will always have a way to refresh their intuition about a
      specific page without it obnoxiously detracting from the overall
      experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Bug Fixes and Future Features:</h3>
    <p>Two violations addressed bug fixes and future features:</p>
    <p>
      1. If I click on the chat button and cancel to go back to the event page
      and then click the chat again it automatically adds me.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Mentions mutual friends? Is there a friending feature? If so, I’m
      unclear on how to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve fixed the issue where clicking on the chat button automatically
      added users without confirmation; the current design displays a
      confirmation dialog before the user is added. Additionally, there will be
      a friending feature similar to platforms like Facebook, allowing users to
      connect and see when mutual friends attend the same events as them.
      Although this feature wasn’t part of the prototype for the heuristic
      evaluation, it’s an essential addition to the app’s functionality and will
      be implemented in the full design.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Overall, the level 3+ violations illuminated many important features and
      behaviors that were lacking in the app’s original design. Our adjustments
      and additions in response to the violations aim to enhance user
      experience, provide necessary guidance, and maintain a secure and
      enjoyable environment within the app
    </p>

    <h2>Future Design Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      Based on user feedback from our A/B testing, a notable comment highlighted
      the dominance of the color blue on our platform, prompting us to address
      and enhance color contrast for better accessibility and readability. To
      achieve this, we can prioritize color combinations with a substantial
      contrast ratio, ensuring that text and crucial elements visibly stand out
      against the background. Additionally, considering the contrast between
      text and its background, such as favoring dark text on a light background
      or vice versa, can contribute to improved visibility; being mindful of
      red-green combinations is crucial to accommodate users with color
      blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorough testing of color combinations across different devices is
      essential, recognizing that colors may vary across screens. Adhering to
      accessibility standards, particularly those outlined in WCAG, and aiming
      for recommended contrast ratios will further enhance the user experience.
      Actively incorporating user feedback from A/B testing allows us to gain
      insights into specific concerns and suggestions. Providing options for
      users to customize color schemes and adjust text sizes can address diverse
      user needs. Leveraging color accessibility tools and conducting regular
      tests for improvements are essential steps toward fostering a positive and
      inclusive user experience on our platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enhance accessibility, we tested our color scheme with settings for
      color insensitivity and reduced blue sensitivity (Figure 11). Finding
      sufficient contrast, we would like to do user testing with individuals
      with visual disabilities for future design.
