    <h1>Design Refinement</h1>

    <h2>
      Decoding the Design: Unraveling the Inner Workings of Bubble's
      Architecture
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our design is a mobile application that fosters building platonic
      relationships through shared experiences at community events. The Bubble
      App aims to create a low barrier to discovering and attending local events
      and promotes forming friendships with other attendees. Specifically
      designed for young professionals relocating to new cities in mind, the app
      addresses the challenges of building new friendships in a new city,
      finding enjoyable activities in an unfamiliar location, and the
      apprehension of attending events solo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon launching the app, the user is greeted by an engaging interface for
      browsing local events. Our design involves two distinctive views for event
      browsing. The first is a scrollable “bubble” view, where each bubble
      represents one event and is intelligently sized according to the user's
      predicted interest. This creates a personalized list and is useful for
      users who want to quickly find events that they’re interested in and care
      less about the location of the event. The second view is a map that offers
      a spatial representation of event locations, catering to those who might
      care more about finding events closer to them. A toggle allows for
      convenient navigation between the two views, ensuring users can choose the
      most suitable option based on their specific preferences and needs. By
      offering two distinctive views for the same overall purpose, our design
      addresses diverse viewing preferences and makes exploring events an
      enjoyable endeavor.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/refinement_report/bubble_map_toggle.jpg"

      width="700"
    />
    <p>
      The user should then flow from viewing a variety of events to selecting
      specific ones that interest them. This will take them to a screen to view
      more details about the event and interact with it (bookmarking for later
      viewing, joining the group chat, or RSVPing to the event). The end goal
      for the user is to RSVP and attend various events that they’re interested
      in while actively connecting with other people by engaging in
      conversations through the chat feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also included user authentication within our design, as a core feature
      of the app is that each user creates their own profile for others to view.
      They have associated data, such as their event preferences, age (to ensure
      they’re above 18), previously attended events, and friends. Not all of
      their associated data is available to other users to ensure privacy and
      safety for all of our users; for example, age is kept off of their public
      profile.
    </p>

    <h2>Crafting Brilliance: Navigating the Path of Design Refinement</h2>
    <p>
      Our design process began with individual paper prototype sketches, which
      were shared in a team meeting. Following a thorough review of everyone’s
      designs, we discussed the strengths of each and selected a primary design
      to move forward with. We took the style of that chosen design and created
      feature sketches of the chat feature and events page of our app. After
      sharing and discussing these sketches and the overall flow of the app, we
      made a final selection to proceed with and then transitioned to
      implementing our designs using Figma.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Down-Scoping of the Project</h3>
    <p>
      During the Figma design phase, we focused on finalizing key aspects such
      as the organization of all elements within our design (main page, event
      page, map view, etc. ). This iterative process allowed us to refine our
      vision and ensure a cohesive and user-friendly interface. Part of this
      refinement involved cutting down on the list of potential features and
      behaviors we wanted our app to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two previously-identified shortcomings of our app were addressed during
      this phase. The first pertained to the inconvenience of requiring users to
      download yet another app. To mitigate this concern, our approach
      emphasized an engaging, clean, and easily accessible design, enhancing the
      app's appeal for potential downloads. The second challenge involved
      potential dexterity issues with the event browsing screen, particularly
      concerning the pinching motion used to resize bubbles, which we originally
      wanted as a way for users to specify their level of interest in various
      events. In response to feedback from team discussions and potential users,
      we decided to eliminate this functionality. Resizing bubbles introduced
      unnecessary complexities for users and detracted from the primary purpose
      of the event browsing screen. The refined design now involves bubbles of
      fixed sizes representing the user's predicted interest in the event
      (larger bubbles = predicted more interest).
    </p>

    <h3>2. Response to Paper Prototyping User Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Our paper prototype consisted of sketches for 2 screens: the bubble layout
      of the event browsing page, and the event details page. It was a simple
      version intended to curate feedback about how intuitive the bubble layout
      would be to new users. The results were positive from user testing; it was
      clear that they understood what the purpose of the app was. It was
      interpreted early on as “an app to show you events happening in your
      city,” indicating that the app’s intention was abundantly clear just from
      those two screens. There was some ambiguity around what it would look like
      to join a group chat for the event or what saving an event meant, but it
      was a good starting point to know the bubble event browsing design was
      sensible. One user specifically thought the chat icon might be a
      registration page for the event, indicating we should consider
      implementing text-based button labels or some other helpful signifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The response to the bubbles as a way of showing events was positive, being
      seen as “fun” and an appealing way to interact with information. A couple
      of users did express a desire to have alternatives to the bubble view to
      explore events, going as far as to list out a map view or calendar view as
      possibilities. We decided to incorporate the map view in our design, as it
      was something we as a team had also discussed as a potential feature.
      Overall, based on the user feedback for our paper prototypes, we gained a
      clear insight into our next steps to improve the app.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Responses to Team-Internal Deliberations</h3>
    <p>
      In a team meeting, we delved into critical aspects of our app’s design.
      The discussion centered around the optimal event viewing workflow —
      whether to utilize a home page with bubbles showcasing only RSVPed events
      or a bubble screen intended for discovering new events. We engaged in a
      substantial discussion about the interface style, weighing the merits of
      Tinder-style swiping versus displaying all events at once in a bubble or
      list format. Drawing inspiration from the [LA
      Events](https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/events) page, we explored a
      list-based design incorporating date and category dropdowns for efficient
      filtering. Emphasizing the utility of a calendar and category filtering
      feature, we envisioned a user-friendly experience where event details are
      accessible without entering each event individually.
    </p>

      src="/mew/media/refinement_report/la_events_categories.jpg"
      alt="LA Events website categories"
      width="700"
    />
    <p>
      Addressing the onboarding process, we considered an approach where users
      are asked to specify initial interests on the screen, and then are taken
      through a guided tutorial through the app’s main features (toggling
      between the bubble and map views, and RSVPing to an event). Additionally,
      we explored the concept of facilitating group chats by allowing users to
      choose people to connect with from the event attendee list, a suggestion
      that resonated with the team. We also created an app logo to emphasize the
      branding and legitimacy of our design, crediting Sela for her
      contribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Navigating through event details and chats prompted further discussion. We
      weighed the options of having a dedicated button in the navigation bar for
      easy access, or accessing the chat feature through the profile screen, as
      we weren’t sure the chat feature should be highlighted to the same degree
      as a core feature like viewing events. We also explored (through more
      paper prototyping) various designs that meshed our bubble branding with a
      functional and intuitive interface for accessing group chats. A design
      involving horizontal lists of bubbles on the profile screen, akin to
      Instagram’s Highlights feature, gained traction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pivotal topic was the inclusion of a map feature. We recognized
      that it fulfilled user desires, but there were varying opinions regarding
      its level of necessity and preferred placement. The team explored
      potential integration options, such as a map icon in the navigation bar or
      a toggle between bubble and map views.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the app’s aesthetic aspects, the team recognized the need to
      finalize a color scheme. We each individually implemented a few designs in
      Figma with varying color schemes, and then posed a quick survey to our
      potential users through an Instagram story to get overall feedback. A
      sleek blue and purple theme won by a significant amount.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/refinement_report/color_scheme_voting.jpg"
      alt="Color scheme results"
      width="700"
    />
    <p>
      Finally, filters were identified as crucial for enhancing user experience,
      to tailor events only to specific locations (regions), activity
      types/categories, age requirements, and more. As we move forward, we are
      committed to refining our designs, specifically establishing a cohesive
      color scheme that aligns with the app’s purpose of facilitating
      connections for young professionals in a new city.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Responses to Heuristic Evaluation Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented a greyscale Figma prototype for the heuristic evaluation to
      pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of flows and functionality rather
      than the aesthetic. The idea was that we didn’t want the feedback to focus
      on aesthetics just yet; we wanted to make sure we really nailed down the
      intuitive-ness of our intended interactions and the flow of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heuristic evaluation feedback highlights several positive aspects of
      the application, such as a simple interface for event pages and the
      seamless integration of maps and social media. However, several important
      concerns were raised regarding confusion about the purpose of the bubble
      view, a desire for a more standardized list view for browsing events, and
      limitations in chat features. The feedback recommended improving the
      design by explicitly explaining the meaning of bubble sizes in the event
      browser view, having info/help buttons on each page to refresh users on
      the app features, and making it clearer on how to interact with certain
      aspects of group chats such as leaving one. Additionally, concerns were
      raised about user privacy and safety (since the app involves meeting what
      are essentially strangers), and the integration of external tools like
      calendars. With these concerns identified, we plan to discuss how to
      address them and make the necessary changes to our design. Our most
      important priority is defining the bubble rules and emphasizing their
      value compared to the map view. Additionally, we will be clearly defining
      each feature of our app, like the difference between saving an event
      versus joining a chat versus RSVPing to an event. Other changes that will
      be made are implementing our chosen color scheme, giving the user a way to
      unRSVP to an event and leave a chat, creating an additional list view of
      the events, and adding filter and search buttons in all views to give
      users more flexibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Navigating Choices: The Tradeoffs Made in Bringing it Online</h2>
    <p>
      Bringing our paper prototype online had distinct advantages in
      understanding user interactions with the app. By having an online
      prototype, we were able to clearly map out the interactions we wanted
      users to have with our app, giving us a clearer understanding of possible
      pain points and frustrations users might have. By shifting, adding, and
      removing visual features, we could explore how different designs and
      configurations would impact a user's experience much faster than we could
      with a paper prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there were some negative consequences of bringing our prototype
      online. Transitioning to a virtual medium demanded thoughtful
      consideration of visual elements, which was rather time-consuming.
      Decisions about colors, fonts, spacings, and overall design aesthetics
      became critical, and anything less than pixel-perfect became much more
      obvious. Additionally, interacting with an app on a computer offers
      distinct functionalities, such as hover actions, that aren’t mirrored in
      mobile interactions. This discrepancy may cause us to overlook design
      flaws that are present in the actual experience.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Unveiling Key Insights: Examining Supported Evidence in the Current Phase
    </h2>
    <p>
      During this phase, we realized that what may seem intuitive to us is not
      necessarily the same for individuals who haven’t invested as much time in
      our product. For example: the bubble view. Our reviewers wondered what the
      purpose of the bubble view served if there was already a map view, which
      some of them viewed as more intuitive and less violating to the eyes.
      Adding the map view actually seemed to reduce the uniqueness and value of
      the bubble view. Additionally, there was confusion about whether the
      bubbles’ size or color had any significant meaning, or if it was just for
      aesthetic purposes. A couple of reviewers also noted that they actually
      preferred seeing information in a more standardized, plain list format
      rather than interacting with cool graphics, stating that it was easier to
      parse information quickly in a list. Based on this feedback, we want to
      explore ways to offer a non-graphical, yet still visually appealing, way
      to process the events posted in our app, such as a list view.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/mew/media/refinement_report/dump_ball_details.jpg"
      alt="Dump Ball event details"
      width="300"
    />
    <p>
      Adding to that, things that we hadn’t thought would be a problem ended up
      being a concern during the heuristic evaluations. For example, our
      reviewers mentioned that they understand that to save an event they have
      to press the large bookmark button; however, they were unsure as to where
      it saves the event.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Project Inquiry: Exploring Unanswered Questions and Acknowledging
      Shortcomings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Regarding the earlier point about the bubble view confusion, the simple
      solution would be to drop the bubble view and pursue refining the map
      view; however, the bubble view has been vital to the identity of our app,
      so we plan to move forward, investigate the design rules of the bubbles
      (size, color, placement, etc.), and solidify what makes them valuable
      compared to the map view. We plan to incorporate user feedback about
      implementing a non-graphical event browsing view as well, such as a list
      view. This will enhance the diversity of options, which will better
      support individual preferences for viewing information.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also some confusion about what it means to save an event or join
      a chat, and what the relationship between those interactions is.
      Originally, we struggled a lot with deciding what it meant to join a chat.
      Would the group chat be a space for people who planned on attending the
      event, or could people who were curious and wanted to scout the vibe
      beforehand join as well? Would joining the chat automatically cause you to
      RSVP to the event? How would a user leave group chats? There is also a
      need for us to solidify aspects of the flow to browse and eventually join
      an event. When saving/joining an event, how would that appear for the
      user? Would the confirmation be in the form of the event being shown on
      the in-app calendar? Would there be a specific section with all of their
      saved/joined events? Would you automatically be added to the chat for the
      event?
    </p>
    <p>
      We plan to investigate these questions by engaging with potential users to
      better understand their preferences for these specific interactions. We
      also will continue drawing inspiration from existing apps to identify
      universally effective structures for organizing and storing elements such
      as events.
