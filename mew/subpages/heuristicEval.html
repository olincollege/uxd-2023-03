    <h1>Heuristic Evaluation for Team Mew</h1>

    <h2>Overall Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      We really appreciated the simple interface when it came to the event page
      and adding ourselves to the chat. We found that navigating to that point
      was fairly straightforward, especially from the map view which felt like
      an intuitive integration of a traditional map app and social media. We did
      find the bubble view very confusing both in purpose and aesthetic. There
      was a lack of understanding of why a bubble would appear in a certain way.
      One other major weakness was the lack of flexibility when it came to the
      chatting features including not having the option to search through
      messages/chats as well as not being able to exit a chat once it was
      joined.
    </p>

    <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
    <p>1. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 1) - Reported by 4</p>
    <p>
      Switch shades for map and bubble view so that the selected view is greyed
      out
    </p>
    <p>2. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 2</p>
    <p>Didn't see a way to look at the list of events I’m planning to attend</p>
    <p>3. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 2</p>
    <p>What do bubble sizes correlate with? Event size, etc.?</p>
    <p>
      4. [Match between system and the real world] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1
    </p>
    <p>
      The bubble view is unclear. How are the bubbles arranged? What bubbles get
      importance? I think the term bubble view does not give enough context for
      this information layout.
    </p>
    <p>5. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      You may just not have implemented it yet, but there is no way to exit an
      event pop-up on the map view. The x does not work and clicking outside the
      pop-up does not close it either. There is an x there though that I assume
      will eventually fix this problem.
    </p>
    <p>6. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 3) - Reported by 3</p>
    <p>
      Will there be a way to leave a chat if you no longer want to be involved
      or joined by accident?
    </p>
    <p>7. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 3) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Will there be the typical chat features of muting notifications, leaving,
      @-ing someone? Most of these I assume aren’t implemented because it’s a
      prototype but I think this would be important to have so a user has
      control over the chat group feature.
    </p>
    <p>8. [Consistency and Standards] (Severity 1) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      I noticed that the bar at the bottom has whichever tab you’re on greyed
      out but the bar at the top has the view you’re not looking at greyed out.
      It’s a bit confusing and unintuitive to have two different systems for
      when something is greyed out.
    </p>
    <p>9. [Error Prevention] (Severity 3) - Reported by 2</p>
    <p>
      None was included in the current prototype, what happens when people try
      to make an event without a name? Or without participants? How would you
      handle users who are trying to do things with the app that it is not
      supposed to?
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t think there was any error prevention in the prototype but it
      should definitely be implemented. Having checked for giving complete event
      info, leaving chats if added mistakenly, etc should definitely be
      included.
    </p>
    <p>10. [Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Maybe having a dashboard of events, or some other quick, text-based, way
      of organizing information could be beneficial for efficient use.
    </p>
    <p>11. [Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Flexibility was there with the many different ways to get to the same
      page. This is a personal preference but I struggle with getting the info
      quickly from a graphical interface and would definitely appreciate a list
      view of some kind for the events.
    </p>
    <p>12. [Aesthetic and Minimalist Design] (Severity 1) - Reported by 2</p>
    <p>
      The bubble and map views seem a bit redundant. There seems to be the
      potential to combine the two views so you can see the event names in
      bubbles on the map so you get all of the same information all in one view.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think some improvements could be made to the bubble page because while
      it was a cool interface I didn’t get the difference between that page and
      just click on different pins on the map.
    </p>
    <p>13. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      I was a little confused by the map versus bubble view, it seems like it’s
      providing a similar interaction (searching a physical space for events).
      Would it make more sense to combine the bubbles and the map into a single
      interaction? What does that bubble view give you that the other view
      doesn’t? Does the bubble view organize the bubbles based on events it
      thinks you’ll like, therefore causing you to see different events than
      what you’d see on the map?
    </p>
    <p>14. [Aesthetic and Minimalist Design] (Severity 1) - Reported by 2</p>
    <p>
      Very minimalist, which is nice, but it feels a bit bland, especially for
      use by young people. Having a stronger color palette would really help Had
      a consistent aesthetic but was really grey. I saw a different page (I
      think) on the Miro board that leaned into the bubble-esque coloring that I
      thought was very cool.
    </p>
    <p>15. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 1) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      No option to use but to log in? I think this choice is ok, but may impact
      the type of engagement and user freedom considering they don’t have to
      option to not share personal information with app developers
    </p>
    <p>
      16. [Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors] (Severity 2)
      - Reported by 2
    </p>
    <p>
      No error messages were included. I didn’t end up in any work-in-progress
      pages but will reference back to my point earlier of having more error
      prevention where I don’t think there were any error messages implemented
      at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>17. [Help and Documentation] (Severity 3) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      I didn’t see a help button but… I don’t think it’s needed at this phase of
      prototyping, especially considering other apps I’ve used will tend to keep
      this information in the settings tab and I don’t think any team is
      focusing on making a settings tab right now.
    </p>
    <p>18. [Help and Documentation] (Severity 3) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      How could you integrate your instructions in such a way that it wouldn't
      be intrusive to a user experience? What other documentation could you
      need? I imagine having instructions for event creation must be important.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t find the need for a ton of help or documentation but I could
      imagine when someone is creating an event for the first time or orienting
      themselves to the app a mini-tutorial might be nice.
    </p>
    <p>19. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      On the event page, what are the extra circles for? Currently are “:)” but
      I'm not sure what they are supposed to be/what they would be used for. If
      it’s supposed to show other people going it feels redundant with the list
      right below the event description which goes through the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>20. [Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      The list of who else is going uses both mutual chats and mutual friends
      when listing people who are going. How does that differentiation work?
    </p>
    <p>21. [Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Plus button at the bottom of the home screen was a bit unclear. Intended
      to add events but took me a second to figure that out. Thought it could be
      another way of adding yourself to chat.
    </p>
    <p>22. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 3) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      If I click on the chat button and cancel to go back to the event page and
      then click the chat again it automatically adds me.
    </p>
    <p>23. [Consistency and Standards] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      On the bubble view, there’s a filter and search icon but they disappear on
      the map view. I think it would be useful to have those features on both.
    </p>
    <p>24. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      There’s a settings option on the event page but I’m not clear on what that
      would be used for unless you were the event owner in which case the
      add-to-chat button wouldn’t be there on the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>25. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 1) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      On the chat list page, it would be nice to have a way to pin the chats
      you’re most interested in at the top.
    </p>
    <p>26. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      On the chat list page, a search bar for messages/chats would be useful for
      quickly finding information.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. [Match between system and the real world] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1
    </p>
    <p>
      Will the calendar integrate with an external feature or only include
      events from the app? If it only includes events from the app, I’m not sure
      it would be as useful as having a feature where someone could
      automatically add an ical to their personal calendar instead.
    </p>
    <p>28. [Aesthetic and Minimalist Design] (Severity 1) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Bubble as title doesn’t totally make sense to me? Why is it called that?
      Retrospectively is this a reference to the olin bubble?
    </p>
    <p>29. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      On the map view, the pins for events have different colors are those
      referencing something?
    </p>

    <p>30. [Flexibility and Efficiency of Use] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>

    <p>
      Is there a way for people to tag certain events? Ex. If I want to only
      look at events with sports would that be something I could filter on? If
      so, does the event creator include that in their description or how would
      I search for things?
    </p>
    <p>31. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 1) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Having the ability to save an event, add to calendar, and add to chat
      feels a bit redundant. Why have a save button if adding it to your
      calendar does the same task?
    </p>
    <p>32. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Are all events open to the public? Is it centered around a college
      community? How does this work if you want to limit events to students in
      your college area?
    </p>
    <p>33. [User Control and Freedom] (Severity 2) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Is there a way to RSVP for an event without joining a chat? There could be
      situations where people might want to say they were going to an event but
      don’t want to be in the chat and only receive vital into such as time or
      location changes.
    </p>
    <p>34. [Visibility of system status] (Severity 3) - Reported by 1</p>
    <p>
      Mentions mutual friends? Is there a friending feature? If so, I’m unclear
      on how to get t

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      This was definitely a really good start to a full prototype. These are a
      few suggestions that came up from more than one person during our
      discussion. These are primarily overarching suggestions and the listed
      heuristic violations have more granular places where things might need to
      be adjusted.
    </p>
    <li>
      Find a clearer way to justify the bubble view or consolidate it into the
      map view
    </li>
    <li>Include a more flexible chat interface</li>
    <li>
      Include a list view of some kind so that people can easily read through
      events without needing to navigate the graphical interface
    </li>
    <li>
      Create more error/help features and documentation throughout the app
    </li>
    <li>
      Have more high-contrast coloring and less grey tones to make things pop
      out more
    </li>
