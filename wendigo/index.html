										<h2>Project Brief</h2>
									</header>
									<p>First time home buyers have a lot of trouble finding the right home and buying a house is a very complicated and potentially life-changing decision. It is really hard to find basic information about a home such as the crime rate, education, price range in a neighborhood.</p>
									<!-- <ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="generic.html" class="button">Learn More</a></li>
									</ul> -->
									<h3>How will your project change the status quo? For whom?</h3>
									<p>Making the home search experience more friendly for first-time buyers will change the status quo by empowering people who maybe haven’t purchased a home because they think they can’t, despite a desire to. Especially for individuals who have no human resources to help them navigate the home-buying world because perhaps they would be the first in their family to buy a house.</p>
									<h3>What is (at least) one naïve design idea (rough sketch)? How does this idea address what you see as the core problem?</h3>
									<p>One solution we came up with is a google extension (like honey) that interfaces with Zillow. Our extension will provide relevant information depending on what you are looking at in Zillow (neighborhood or home) and gives you all the information you need in a convenient place like crime rate, education, etc. It will also give you a price breakdown, including taxes, realty fees, and federal tax benefits.</p>
									<h3>What information do you need to collect? How will you collect it? How will you meet your target users, or who can serve as effective proxies for them?</h3>
									<p>We will need to collect information on houses and how the pricing is created, the process of buying a home from the perspective of a first-time home buyer, what goes into calculating property value, what goes into making a house eligible for first time home buyer loan, and essentially what information about a home is most useful for a prospective buyer to know in order to make an educated decision.</p>
									<h3>How will your team work together to accomplish these goals (as well as your individual learning goals)?</h3>
									<h4><strong>Team Goals:</strong></h4>
									<ul>
										<li>We will properly divide and conquer so that no one is pressured.</li>
										<li>We will set up a rotating schedule for interviewing in case conflicts occur.</li>
										<li>We will prepare for if one of us is unable to attend.</li>
										<li>Being open-minded and listening</li>
										<li>Not shooting an idea on the spot and having a conversation about it</li>
									</ul>
									<h4><strong>Inidividual Goals:</strong></h4>
									<h4>Dre:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Be punctual in finding and executing user interviews.</li>
										<li>Understand the background of buying homes</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Aaron:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>I want to learn more about what buying a home entails</li>
										<li>I want to learn what is to be a user experience designer</li>
										<li>I want to improve my interview and organization skills</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Gabby:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Learn about the home buying process, especially the loan process</li>
										<li>Improve Figma experience</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Brooklyn:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Become knowledgeable and confident in using Figma. </li>
										<li>Learn about the process of purchasing a home, specifically as a first-time buyer, and use insightful research to inform the user via our app mockup.</li>

										<h2>Needs Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The first phase of our design process focused on identifying and articulating the needs of our target user group: first-time homebuyers. This section contains multiple, diverse, artifacts that
										capture our process in this phase. Here's an overview, with each individual design artifact or tool in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

									<h3>Process Overview</h3>
									<p>Using our <strong>Consent Narrative</strong>, we interviewed first-time and experienced
									home-buyers. With the information gathered from those meetings, we
									re-examined our Project Brief and refined it into our <strong>Design Brief</strong>, from our
									new lens of what pain points are for home-buyers and what problems they
									would actually want solved. Two contextual models helped frame our
									problem: a <strong>Flow Model</strong> of the home-buying process with all the entities
									and processes involved, and a <strong>Cultural Model</strong> of the pressures exerted on
									the home-buyer by the other stakeholders during the process. From our
									interviews, we summarized our data by <strong>Experience Mapping</strong> first-time
									home buyers' overall journey from searching to signing off on their homes,
									addressing their goals, touchpoints, and feelings along the way.</p>
									
									<p>Next, we created <strong>two personas</strong> based on the themes we saw emerging
										from the people we spoke to highlighting, among other things, the
										difference in intent between home buyers: those who want to live in the
										home they buy versus those who are using the home as an investment.
										Finally, we fleshed out our <strong>Narrative Grounding Approach</strong>, making the
										problem (of an unpredictable and complicated home-buying process)
										explicit and outlining how our solution will counter the pain points
										expressed through our personas.</p>
									
									<p>Lastly, the <strong>Effort Chart</strong> summarizes the work we did as a team. For this
										phase, it might be evident that we each took the lead on separate parts of
										the process and developing the relevant deliverables.</p>
									
									<h3>Consent Narrative</h3>
									<p>This is the document we would provide users before interviews to reach frame our 
										relationship relative to them and help them be more comfortable speaking with us. 
										Our Consent Narrative can be viewed <a href="docs/consent_narrative.pdf">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
									<p>In order to situate our users in the broader context that they exist in, we created two
											models to understand their relationships with factors outside of them. One of these is 
											a flow model, and the other is a culture model. These can be seen below:</p>
									<img src="images/flow_model.png" alt="Image of Flow Model", style="max-width: 100%;">
									<img src="images/culture_model.png" alt="Image of Culture Model", style="max-width: 100%;">

									<h3>Design Brief</h3>
									<p>We refined our initial project brief to specify the problem we're solving and our proposed solution to it. We structured it through a few key questions:</p>
									<h4><strong>What problem are you proposing to solve?</strong></h4>
									<p>We are trying to reduce stress and uncertainty in the complicated, long, and uncertain
										process of buying a home, including single-family houses, townhouses, multi-family
										houses, and condominiums. Although the people we spoke to with more experience
										buying a house understandably feel more confident in buying a house over time, it's
										almost always a long, winding, and frustrating process for all buyers, old and new.</p>
									
									<p>From our interviews, we discovered a few pain points that were common across multiple
										interviewees: hidden fees, an overwhelming web of property, lending, and housing
										regulations, difficulty finding reliable information about niche needs, understanding if the
										price being paid for a house was fair, and a lack of clarity in the overall process.</p>
									
									<p>The pain point of actually finding a house, which we were initially looking at, seemed to
										be pretty well-covered by Zillow and countless other sites. Often, the larger issue in this
										step was the speed at which houses would sell out - all our interviewees reported
										frustration about how quickly houses they liked would be sold before they got to tour the
										house and place an offer. We don't aim to solve the problem of the pace of a market,
										but we hope that our solution will provide packaged information and clarity on process
										more quickly so that buyers are generally more confident placing an offer.</p>
									
									<h4><strong>Who matters?</strong></h4>
									<p>The home-buyers are our primary users, particularly inexperienced home-buyers who
										need to be more expert on the minute ins and outs of the home-buying process and
										have never purchased a property. This is the user group we will be designing for. Other
										stakeholder groups that will be important in this interaction will be realtors (since the
										solution we are proposing, in many ways, is what homebuyers rely on realtors for) and
										external regulatory bodies (from which we will need local information to accurately
										outline the process and calculate hidden fees).</p>

									<h4><strong>How do your prospective users think about this problem/activity?</strong></h4>
									<p>Home-buyers have said that they retrospectively wished they had more clarity on what
										to expect in the process of buying a house. Knowing about the hidden fees from the
										beginning and having access to detailed information that is less obviously related to
										choosing the right home would have saved them quite a lot of stress or money. Homebuyers
										also talk about relying on their realtors a lot, which in some cases is beneficial if
										they get a great realtor but in other cases has added to stress if the realtor is trying to
										upsell or has incomplete knowledge about the process.</p>

									<h4><strong>What requirements must your solution satisfy? (think about different
										stakeholders)</strong></h4>
									<p>Our older stakeholders (e.g.- people looking to buy a retirement home) spoke about
										how the solution must be a website/have a website option since phone screens are too
										small for them. All stakeholders relied on current popular home-hunting websites like
										Zillow and felt that our product should integrate well with them. Our solution should have
										executive summaries for a lot of the information since people said that the problem
										wasn't not enough information, but too much. It should certainly account for stat-bystate
										differences in housing rules and processes. Lastly, it should have a
										comprehensive checklist/progress tracker of all the tasks within homebuying so that
										users know what to expect, regulatory bodies/banks know that rules are being followed,
										and supporting service providers (like realtors) have accountability.</p>

									<h4><strong>What will the impact of a successful solution be?</strong></h4>
									<p>Homebuyers of all levels of experience can go through the process without surprises
										that could be prevented within their control. There will be no fees they weren’t expecting
										or disappointments they weren’t prepared for. It will be clear how various processes
										work and they will effectively be able to find and use the information they are looking for.
										Overall, the solution will empower and center homebuyers in the web of stakeholders in
										the messy world of housing markets. It will provide transparency in the process, and
										reduce a lot of stress for people who are in the process of buying a house.</p>
									
										<h3>Customer Experience Mapping</h3>
										<p>As part of identifying needs, we also realized that it would be helpful to understand the 
											journey of a customer using our potential project. Here's a diagram to summarize that 
											information.</p>
										<img src="images/customer_journey.png" alt="Customer Experience Map", style="max-width: 100%;">
											
										<h3>Personas</h3>
										<p>A key part of identifying needs was to build out personas that we could design for. We came up 
											with two personas that effectively summarized our user group: Newbie Ned and Investor Ivy</p>
										<img src="images/ned.png" alt="Persona Ned", style="max-width: 100%;">
										<img src="images/ivy.png" alt="Persona Ivy", style="max-width: 100%;">

										<h3>Narrative Grounding Approach</h3>
										<p>Once we had our personas, we started making the
											problem (of an unpredictable and complicated home-buying process)
											explicit and outlining how our solution will counter the pain points
											expressed through our persona. Here are some key questions we asked:</p>
	
										<h4><strong>What is the problem?</strong></h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Currently no all-in-one place documentation for buying a house</li>
											<ul><li>Not explained in layman's terms</li></ul>
											<li>Process is long and complicated</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Especially for first time buyers, they lose track of where in the process they are at</li>
												<li> People don’t even know what they should look for</li>
											</ul>
											<li>Regulations differs from state to state</li>
											<li>Lots of hidden fees and rules (e.g.- insurance on mortgage if down payment less than 20%)</li>
										</ul>

										<h4><strong>Our solution:</strong></h4>
										<ul>
											<li>A website/app portal (?) that manages and explains the entire process of buying a house</li>
											<li>Landing page could be option to enter Zip Code like <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/">healthcare.gov</a></li>
											<li>User enters a bunch of information about their house buying goals</li>
											<li>Tailored to account for local/state regulations</li>
											<li>Provides an overview of all the steps that the user can look at anytime: potentially looks like a progress bar</li>
											<li>Estimates hidden fees, future issues that could arise</li>
										</ul>

										<h4><strong>Why is it meaningful?</strong></h4>
										<ul>
											<li>It save our users time and headache by:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Explaining the entire process clearly</li>
												<li>Estimating hidden fees/overall cost</li>
												<li>Keeping track</li>
											</ul>
											<li>It will help prevent mistakes</li>
											<ul>
												<li>User will not regret a decision because they lacked information they didn’t know
													would be important; our site will tell them what to look for and get information on
													based on their housing needs and preferences. E.g. -  if user has or plans to have kids, site will tell them what factors they
													should look into</li>
												<li>Users can make well-informed decisions thanks to the process guide provided on
													the site</li>
											</ul>
										</ul>

										<h3>Effort Chart</h3>
										<p>Lastly, we documented the relative effort everyone put into the project in different areas.
											We tried to make our own version of this effort chart, with circles to specify the work we did
											and our initials written in relative sizes to indicate how much we contributed to that task.
										</p>

											<li>DH - Dre Hilton</li>
											<li>AH - Aaron Huang</li>
											<li>VK - Vedaant Kuchhal</li>

										<h2>Design Development</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Our findings from Needs Analysis informed our next phase: Design Development.
										Here we present a portfolio of our design ideas, followed by various supporting
										design and process artifacts that outline our journey to those ideas.
									</p>

									<h3>Design Portfolio</h3>
									<p>Once we had identified our user's needs in our Needs Analysis phase, we had a meandering, 
										slightly chaotic journey to our current prototype. In the process, we considered a wide 
										range of design ideas en route to the idea we committed to.</p>
									<img src="images/design_process.png" alt="Design Process" style="max-width: 100%;">

									<h4><strong>Idea 1: User Journey Roadmap</strong></h4>
									<p>One of the most important design ideas in our portfolio (that we ultimately pivoted away from), 
										was to have the home-buying journey laid out like a visual road map, with details about each 
										step of the journey and a checklist of important tasks for them to record and follow. 
										Here's an example of a representation:</p>
									<img src="images/idea1_example.png" alt="Typical Homebuying Journey", style="max-width: 100%;">
									
									<p>The intent was to focus on the user's need of wanting to be more informed about the flow of the home buying process and more prepared for the bumps and inevitable surprises inherent to the process, but we moved away from this idea, retaining elements in our final idea (which will be revealed soon). We did not proceed with this idea for two reasons:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Not personalized - one of the patterns emerging from our Needs Analysis was that the home-buying process is incredibly personal and situation-specific, and we recognized that a personalized website would be a necessary value-add.</li>
										<li>Other options exist - we found numerous alternative websites, such as <a href="https://www.newhomesource.com/learn/steps-to-buying-a-new-home/">this one</a>, that already do this! While we hadn't found these websites from our initial research, further digging showed many resource pages that were already addressing this.</li>
									</ol>
									
									<h4><strong>Idea 2: Zillow Extension for House Evaluation</strong></h4>
									<p>Another idea we considered was an extension for Zillow. We understood that Zillow is already a great tool for finding homes and it would not make much sense to try to build a whole new home-finding site to compete with it. Depending on what page of Zillow the user was looking at, the extension would provide helpful information.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The user needs that this extension focused on were the uncertainty of whether the house you're looking at is the house for you, especially in terms of financials and hidden expenses that could be debilitating.</li>
										<li>Examples of how the extension could work:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>If looking at the neighborhood map feature of a certain zip code, the extension would pull relevant information from Zillow and outside sources about that are giving scores on schools, distance to entertainment, crime, natural disaster vulnerability</li>
											<li>If looking at a specific house's page, the extension would give a score of the house baked on weighted criteria inputted by the user into the extension like an overall score of the house (if user prioritizes a nice, big primary bathroom, a house with their ideal bathroom but a bad kitchen will get a higher score than a house with a small primary bathroom but a decent kitchen)</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>

									<h4><strong>Idea 3: Personalized Tracker</strong></h4>
									<p>The homebuying process is very complicated for first time homebuyers. We would take information like location, relevant documents, and type of house to make a personalized tracker. The main feature would be the personalized tracker where it will tell the user the current step they are at, but will include other important features, such as a checklist and important messages. This will help keep buyers informed and on top of the process.</p>
									
									<h4><strong>Other Ideas</strong></h4>
									<ul>
										<li>An AI real estate agent that alleviates most issues that arise from a real estate agent.</li>
										<li>An app that helps people find and pick houses</li>
										<ul>
											<li>This app would be a competitor of Zillow with many of the capabilities of Zillow plus the functionalities of the above extension</li>
											<li>It addresses the needs of both Newbie Ned and Investor Ivy (our persona) by helping both inexperienced and experienced buyers find and get in contact with home sellers</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>

									<h3>Idea Sketches</h3>
									<p>We sketched out each of these ideas as part of the process of specifying and eliminating to narrow down on a single, refined concept.</p>
									<img src="images/idea_sketches.png" alt="Idea Sketches" style="max-width: 100%;">
									<p>Full sketches can be found <a href="docs/idea_sketches.pdf">here</a></p>

									<h3>Evaluation</h3>
									<p>After comparing our ideas against our brief and validating that our ideas create some form of new value that does not already exist we came to the conclusion that the personalized tracker would best meet our users’ needs and add value even in the case that the user already has the help and guidance of a realtor.</p>
									<h4>The features of this approach are the following:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>A personal progress bar</li>
										<li>A task checklist</li>
										<li>Things to look out for</li>
										<li>Document/Form summarization</li>
										<li>Access to local rules and regulations</li>
										<li>Document storage</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Storyboard</h3>
									<p>Now that we were gradually narrowing down on our product idea, we attempted to chart out a user's journey through our product in an interaction flow diagram. Here is the external link to our <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNad9Oy0=/?share_link_id=969595262128">Interaction Flow</a></p>

									<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
									<p>Next, we created a low-fidelity paper prototype of our proposed product to better understand its features and test with users in co-designs.
										Images of all the interfaces of the full prototype can be found <a href="docs/paper_prototype.pdf">here</a>
									</p>
									
									<h3>Idea Testing</h3>
									<p>So far we have conducted 1 co-design session and scheduled for a second one later this week. See interview notes (externally linked) <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15g3bBVh1WCY2gFzWlAcOD5f4bPbyk1xp?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
									 <h4>Below are our key insights:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>There is already a solution to a storage locker feature currently called Docusign, so if we were to implement such a thing it would be an integration with that.</li>
										<li>The journey map would be extremely helpful especially if it included a timeline</li>
										<li>Blog name may need to be changed because blog == opinions</li>
										<li>The blog and FAQ pages are a bit cluttered and may be combined to make it more simple</li>
										<li>Love the idea of AI Chatbot</li>
										<li>Hate logging in and giving out emails. Wouldn’t especially trust this website unless from lawyer/realtor</li>
										<li>Having a module on the dashboard with relevant links to blog pages or anticipated questions would be very helpful</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Report</h3>
									<p>With everything we learned so far, we produced a report for our presumed client for this product:</p>
									<p>"Home Buddy," is a website tailored for first-time home buyers. It operates as a personalized assistant, helping users navigate the often intricate process of purchasing their first home. With a focus on organization, Home Buddy enables users to easily track important documents, notes, and specific information relevant to home buying policies in their specific area. What sets it apart is its engaging and interactive approach, complete with a personalized avatar and a custom progress bar to represent the user's position on their home buying journey, making the experience both enjoyable and motivating.</p>
									<p>Moreover, the website incorporates unique features, including an AI chatbot. This AI chatbot serves as a specialized assistant, providing answers to home-buying questions within the context of the user's account and readily available internet information. It's important to note that the chatbot is designed to complement rather than replace the guidance of a real estate agent, offering users a secondary advisory resource. In essence, Home Buddy aims to streamline and personalize the home buying experience, making it more user-friendly, engaging, and informative for first-time buyers.</p>
									<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>
									<p>Home Buddy works in two different ways. First, it acts as a generalized timeline for folks who don't have an account. In this case, the website is click based and doesn’t contain any of the user’s personal information. In the other case, the user will be prompted with a login button at the top right of the screen. By clicking this, it brings them to a page that allows them to either sign up or log in. If someone is signing up, there will be a set of questions that the website gives to start personalizing the tracker. Once an account is made and the user has answered all the questions, they will be greeted with our dashboard which contains basic information as well as the tracker. From here, there are three possible places to click that will take you to another section of the website. First, by clicking on the tracker, you will be taken to a page that has more in depth details about the current step as well as access to other steps through a click. Next, there is a documents page which holds all relevant documents that a person needs to actually purchase a house successfully. Here the documents will be separated and summarized. Lastly, the user will be able to chat with our personalized chatbot which knows the information and can help make decisions.</p>
									<h4><strong>Based on what you told us</strong></h4>
									<p>More than one user has told us that there was just so much they didn’t know about looking back on the process. They wished they had more knowledge going into home buying then they did at the time. And especially when they had a realtor, a big component of the process that they had to have was trust in their realtor as a professional who had their best interests in mind. It was hard to build that confidence on their own and have that understanding such that they could be working with their agent rather than only being able to trust their agent to guide them.</p>
									<p>Our design gives our users that confidence and control over their personal process by providing knowledge about the general process and a way to acquire knowledge unique to them and to store that personalized information all in one place. Our site explains the entire process at a high-level so users can familiarize themselves before they really start and have that prior knowledge coming in. In addition to having access to important information all in one place, they can also save and document their progress and specific information and media (signed forms and documents) all in one place for ebay reference in the future.</p>
									<p>However, users not only mentioned lack of knowledge, but also that the information they were gaining came in fast and was hard to understand. Our site presents relevant information in a way that is not overwhelming and is easy for anyone to understand not only about the general process but about forms and which agreements to expect when along with a summary of those forms and what sections are important in those documents, so users can also feel like they know what’s going and how each paper they sign fits into the process.</p>
									<p>Overall, our design meets user needs by empowering them through the process with information and easy tracking of their progress. However, it does fall short in some areas such that it cannot help them find an exact house, but instead provides prompting questions for users to know what they should look out for. Multiple users mentioned wishing they had more information about the surroundings of the house, be it natural or social. For instance one user said they wanted to find information about data for floodplains in the area they were interested in. Rather than the site providing that information or even a link to where they can find it, instead we would ask them a question like, “Is your area susceptible to certain natural disasters? If so, which ones? Which areas are safest?” There is too much weather information out there that is always changing for our site to always have that data on hand for a specific user, but we can help users know that climate in their desired area is important to consider and that they should take steps to know that information.</p>
									<h4><strong>What were other ideas?</strong></h4>
									<p>We considered many designs before we reached our current version. Here are some small but impactful designs we considered before arriving where we are now.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Different progress bars (it took many iterations to get to our current one)</li>
										<li>Including FAQ section</li>
										<li>Search bar used to be a conventional search bar</li>
										<li>Entering search area as zip code and location</li>
									</ol>
									<h4><strong>Insights</strong></h4>
									<p>We found many key insights as we have iterated on our design. We made our first insight early on in our design, which was don’t create solutions to problems that have already been solved. Our first idea helped first time homebuyers by helping them find the right home. This sounds awfully familiar to Zillow and other real estate websites and they do a pretty good job at helping buyers find the right home.</p>
									<p>After pivoting to our current design idea, we encountered our second insight: realtors are a good resource already. We kept that in mind while designing our website so that we are providing the knowledge and tools that keep buyers informed rather than outright replacing a realtor. Through our research, we found a surprisingly large amount of resources that are out there describing the process. However, there aren’t any that are both detailed and comprehensive. Because of this, we added features such as the blog and FAQ sections to provide a knowledge hub for our user group.</p>

									<h3>Effort Chart</h3>
									<p>Lastly, our effort chart reflects our individual effort in this phase. We chose a different chart
										type than last time to better present our overall contributions over that period.

								<h3>Design Overview</h3>
								<p>Our website helps first-time homebuyers navigate the homebuying process. The website contains a few key features to achieve this aim:</p>
								<ol>
									<li> A home page detailing various features. The most important among these is a search bar, where a user can enter the location of an area they are considering buying a home in.
									<img src="images/landing_page_old.png" alt="Home Page (Old)", style="max-width: 100%;">
									</li>
									<li>Searching for a given location navigates to a homebuying journey page, which outlines the homebuying process for a given location with key steps.
									<img src="images/user_journey_old.png" alt="Home-buying Journey Page (Old)", style="max-width: 100%;">
									</li>
									<li>An AI chatbot that a homebuyer can ask questions to. This chatbot is easily accessible and can be found with a single click on any of our websites pages. This chatbot isn’t actually implemented in an interactive way yet since that is difficult to do.
									<img src="images/chatbot_new.png" alt="Chatbot (New)", style="max-width: 100%;">
									</li>
									<li>A “Resources” page . On this page, the user can look at key scenarios that first-time homebuyers usually need help with and understand.
									<img src="images/resources_old.png" alt="Resources Page (Old)", style="max-width: 100%;">
									</li>
								</ol>
							
							
								<p>The above features all exist without the user needing to log in to the website. However, once the user has logged into the website (and is therefore able to save information between sessions), they can access the most important page of this site: the dashboard.</p>
								<p>The dashboard is a single place where the user can track and manage information regarding the homebuying process. This includes checklists to keep track of tasks, a progress tracker to indicate the position of the user in the overall journey, and features like a finance calculator.</p>
								<img src="images/dashboard_old.png" alt="Dashboard (Old)", style="max-width: 100%;">
								<p>Additionally, once the user is logged in, we also have a set of features such as allowing users to pick their avatar, review their privacy settings, and perform actions such as changing passwords.</p>

								<h3> Notable Changes</h3>
								<p>We made the following key changes to our prototype as we transitioned into Figma, all using feedback from co-designs in the Design Development phase:</p>
								<ul>
									<li> We renamed the “Blogs” page to “Resources” because from feedback on the paper prototype, blogs made it seem like the page was a place for posting which was a bit misleading.</li>
									<li>Based on user feedback that logging in and providing sensitive information was a deterrent to using the site, we maximized the features that were accessible without logging in. These include the home page, homebuying journey map, and more.</li>
									<li>We also decided to get rid of the forms and documents section of our website because the market competition addresses this need in a sufficient way that our product did not need to provide. </li>
									<li>We redesigned the homepage to only include blurbs about the AI chatbot, personalized tracker, and expert feedback so that the consumer could get the gist of our product from what we were doing. </li>
									<li>Lastly, we kept the modularity of our dashboard but incorporated a few more elements than on the paper prototype to show the progress of the user more succinctly. </li>
								</ul>
							
								<h3> Tradeoffs</h3>
								<p>When moving our prototype from paper screens to Figma, we expectedly had to trade-off and downscope certain features that would be significantly more difficult within the constraints of our limited Figma experience.  For example, our dashboard progress tracker is stagnant (since it isn't easy to have movable icons in Figma). Additionally, we had to create multiple variations of each page to account for signing in, and other features like the ability to change the layout of the dashboard is lost. In terms of iteration, because everything has shifted into being focused on detail, in order to make the functions look correct, we have to spend more time on the smaller things. This slowed down the process of working on feedback as opposed to purely speaking through and capturing the process on paper.</p>

								<h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
								<p> Through our cognitive walkthroughs we found many bugs and we also received great feedback about what feature flows were unclear or unexpected and will be really useful for the next phase.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Here is the link to our first Cognitive Walkthrough: <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WusUV1np24v4uByM61HixTy-2dbkh-pRk_oDDOfud4Y/edit?usp=sharing"> Cognitive Walkthrough 1 - Google Docs</a></li>
									<li>And here is the link for our second Cognitive Walkthrough:<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlNnODCAGeqaptQSuxazZ22MSUz8RnUcuRbTeI1mRjE/edit?usp=sharing"> Cognitive Walkthrough 2 - Google Docs</a></li>

								</ul>

								<h3>Heuristic Evaluations</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Here is the link to our group Heuristic Evaluation document summarizing our feedback along with each of our individual evaluations in the Appendix: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHumI-YlhrxiW33FwTwUbmBlyQtaejikxeO-c6Xep4Y/edit?usp=sharing"> Group Heuristic Eval - Google Docs</a></li>
								</ul>


								<h3>Heuristic Feedback</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LGHJXKcdk5zsSko-JeEa4DbIPUox0MtCU_iNyKSHQTI/edit?usp=sharing"> link</a> to the feedback we received from Team 4 (Big Scary Dragons).</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Key Insights</h3>
								<p>Our heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough proved to be fruitful in identifying our assumptions and biases about our projects. For example, multiple people stated that they did not understand the purpose of entering a location on the home page. They expected a list of results rather than a new page with a scrollable walkthrough of the homebuying journey. This showed that mental connections between pages that seem clear to us are not always clear to a user.</p>
								<p>Additionally, we needed to think beyond our initial vision of our website and make sure everything is accessible for the user when they want it and not when we intended. For example, for the user journey page, we thought of it as a quick view of what the website was about before committing to sign up, which is not what users interpreted it as.</p>
								<p>Lastly, we were surprised by how powerful words are as mental model influencers and word choice can drastically change the function of an element a user expects. For example, as we mentioned earlier, the resources page was originally called the blog page and this also created misunderstandings about what this page had to offer. The feedback from heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs only confirmed this insight.</p>

								<h3>Modifications</h3>
								<p>We were able to act on some feedback from the heuristice evaluations, although the bulk of that work will occur in the next, and final phase of the project. Here are some of the highlights:</p>

								<p>Homepage: removing the confusing search bar for something more clear</p>
								<img src="images/landing_page_new.png" alt="Home Page (New)", style="max-width: 100%;">
								<p>Home-buying Journey Page: adding a more detailed and explanatory format of the journey</p>
								<div class="scroll">
									<img src="images/landing_page_old.png" alt="Home Page (Old)", style="max-width: 100%;">

								<p>Dashboard page: adding labels for relevant icons and add functionality of adding a house</p>
								<img src="images/dashboard_new.png" alt="Dashboard (New)", style="max-width: 100%;">
								<p>Resources page: adding scrollability and improved labels and readability</p>

								<p>Avatar page: making better customization images</p>
								<img src="images/avatar_new.png" alt="Avatar Page (New)", style="max-width: 100%;">
								
								<h3>Questions and Shortcomings</h3>
								<p>Through our design refinement and associated feedback (cognitive walkthroughs and heuristic evaluations), we encountered deeper questions about our product that are as yet unresolved. Our current prototypes don't address these concerns yet, but we want to be transparent about the fact that these came up and that we are keeping them under consideration.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The website was originally designed for someone starting the home-buying process after they had found a house. Now we have shifted this group to include people who may not have even found a house and we would like to investigate how to make the information we provide easy to understand, and make the flow of that information between website pages more intuitive. </li>
									<li>One shortcoming we have is that other teams did not see the financial aspects and integrations into the site that they would have liked. Moving forward we should have more transparency about the financial process of home-buying, as that is a core part of our original mission. </li>
									<li>As we are working with sensitive personal information, such as mortgages, contracts, and agent-client communications, we need to be aware of privacy concerns and what we do with the data.
								</ul>

								<h3>Effort Chart</h3>
								<p>Lastly, here is an account of our respective contributions to this phase, in the form of written accounts.</p>
								<p>Gabby - I developed the User Journey page, and helped refine the dashboard, resources, landing, and FAQ pages and conducting cognitive walkthroughs</p>
								<p>Aaron - I focused on refining the sign up page, dashboard, resources, account settings, vehicle selection, and chatbot and conducting cognitive walkthroughs</p>
								<p>Vedaant - I mainly worked on collating and formatting the deliverables for the submission of this phase. I didn't really work on Figma, but helped with the Heuristic Evaluation and project management.</p>
								<p>Brooklyn - Worked on Figma dashboard, homepage, and FAQ. Interactive buttons on the homepage. Heuristic Evaluation combining, feedback discussion and figma revision.</p>
								<p>Dre- Worked on Figma resources, avatar, ai chatbot, writeup deliverables, and converting into html.</p>

										<h2>Final Refinement</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In the final phase of our project, we developed the final version of our website. We incorporated all the feedback from the previous phase to make appropriate adjustments, conducted a pilot of a formal usability study using A/B testing, and produced our final product.</p>
									
									<h3>Usability Study</h3>
									<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
									<p><strong>Summary hypothesis:</strong> If we change the layout of the home-buying journey page from scrollable to clickable overlays on one page, then the user will have higher scores on our quiz to check their understanding of the purpose of our site.</p>
									<p><strong>Description:</strong> Our study is an A/B test of the User Journey Map page, and it would allow us to test the usability of the site specifically as it relates to its purpose - do users understand what the website is supposed to be for? This is motivated by feedback from our previous phase where we were told that this was not immediately clear. Since it's beyond the scope of this phase to test the entire website, we will be focusing on the webpage that users found to be the most ambiguous - the User Journey Map page. The User Journey Map page is the first page that the users would interact with that provides them information, therefore it is essential that the purpose of this page helps the user understand the purpose of the site.</p>

									<h4>Independent Variables</h4>
									<p>Currently, the User Journey Map page is shown as a scrolling menu that contains each step of the user's journey. The change that we will make allows all of the information to exist on one page. Each step of the journey will be represented as a button which when clicked pops up an overlay of the details of the step. <strong>For the purpose of this study, we will call the current scroll-based page Version 1, and the proposed click-based variant Version 2.</strong></p>
									<p>Between the two variants of the page, the information and order of steps remain constant but the package in which the information is delivered is different.</p>
									<p>By changing between scroll-based and click-based functionality, we are testing the condition of how information is stored. By having a button layout, all of the information is stored on the same page which could allow for easy access whereas with a scrolling menu, you'll need to scroll to access the information.</p>
									
									<h4>Dependent Variable</h4>
									<p>Separate from the factors that we are changing, we want the actual information and the order of steps to remain constant. In doing this, we are hoping to observe how the user digests the information and content within the website between Version 1 and Version 2.</p>
									<p>By shifting the container of information, we will be able to gauge how users are actually interacting with the information and what they perceive the purpose of the journey map and thereby, our site to be. We will do this by asking the following specific multiple-choice questions and aggregating a score.</p>

									<ol>
										<li>After looking at this website, do you think that you understand the homebuying process better? (Scale 1-5)</li>
										<li>How many steps are there in the home buying process? (List options for steps)</li>
										<li>Based on what you've seen, what do you think the overall goal of this website is? (list 5 options from least to most intended)</li>
										<li>Is the information about any given phase easily accessible? (Scale 1-5)</li>
										<li>Would you engage with this website when you start the homebuying process? (Scale 1-5)</li>
										<li>Is the information about the home-buying process helpful? (Scale 1-5)</li>
										<li>Do you wish that the website had a different layout? (Scale 1-5)</li>
									</ol>
								
									<h4>Expected Response</h4>
									<p>We expect that in Version 2 of the webpage, the purpose of the website will be easier to understand since all the information is presented in the same place. Instead of scrolling through multiple steps, it will be more evident that the website is a guide to support users through the entirety of the home-buying process. In other words, participants interacting with Version 2 will score higher than those interacting with Version 1.</p>

									<h4>Number of Participants</h4>
									<p>Since this is a pilot study, we’re not going to try to enroll hundreds of participants. Instead, we will try to enroll four users with no prior knowledge of our design (i.e. not the teaching team or team that reviewed us for Heuristic Evaluation) and split them into groups of two - one pair independently testing Version 1 (scrolling menu), and the other pair independently testing Version 2 (clicking menu). Our users will most likely be Olin College students, once again for convenience given that this is a pilot study.</p>

										<h2>Design Refinement</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Our findings from Needs Analysis informed our next phase: Design Development.
										Here we present a portfolio of our design ideas, followed by various supporting
										design and process artifacts that outline our journey to those ideas.
									</p>

									<h3>Design Portfolio</h3>
									<p>Once we had identified our user's needs in our Needs Analysis phase, we had a meandering, 
										slightly chaotic journey to our current prototype. In the process, we considered a wide 
										range of design ideas en route to the idea we committed to.</p>
									<img src="images/design_process.png" alt="Design Process" style="max-width: 100%;">

									<h4><strong>Idea 1: User Journey Roadmap</strong></h4>
									<p>One of the most important design ideas in our portfolio (that we ultimately pivoted away from), 
										was to have the home-buying journey laid out like a visual road map, with details about each 
										step of the journey and a checklist of important tasks for them to record and follow. 
										Here's an example of a representation:</p>
									<img src="images/idea1_example.png" alt="Typical Homebuying Journey", style="max-width: 100%;">
									
									<p>The intent was to focus on the user's need of wanting to be more informed about the flow of the home buying process and more prepared for the bumps and inevitable surprises inherent to the process, but we moved away from this idea, retaining elements in our final idea (which will be revealed soon). We did not proceed with this idea for two reasons:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Not personalized - one of the patterns emerging from our Needs Analysis was that the home-buying process is incredibly personal and situation-specific, and we recognized that a personalized website would be a necessary value-add.</li>
										<li>Other options exist - we found numerous alternative websites, such as <a href="https://www.newhomesource.com/learn/steps-to-buying-a-new-home/">this one</a>, that already do this! While we hadn't found these websites from our initial research, further digging showed many resource pages that were already addressing this.</li>
									</ol>
									
									<h4><strong>Idea 2: Zillow Extension for House Evaluation</strong></h4>
									<p>Another idea we considered was an extension for Zillow. We understood that Zillow is already a great tool for finding homes and it would not make much sense to try to build a whole new home-finding site to compete with it. Depending on what page of Zillow the user was looking at, the extension would provide helpful information.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The user needs that this extension focused on were the uncertainty of whether the house you're looking at is the house for you, especially in terms of financials and hidden expenses that could be debilitating.</li>
										<li>Examples of how the extension could work:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>If looking at the neighborhood map feature of a certain zip code, the extension would pull relevant information from Zillow and outside sources about that are giving scores on schools, distance to entertainment, crime, natural disaster vulnerability</li>
											<li>If looking at a specific house's page, the extension would give a score of the house baked on weighted criteria inputted by the user into the extension like an overall score of the house (if user prioritizes a nice, big primary bathroom, a house with their ideal bathroom but a bad kitchen will get a higher score than a house with a small primary bathroom but a decent kitchen)</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>

									<h4><strong>Idea 3: Personalized Tracker</strong></h4>
									<p>The homebuying process is very complicated for first time homebuyers. We would take information like location, relevant documents, and type of house to make a personalized tracker. The main feature would be the personalized tracker where it will tell the user the current step they are at, but will include other important features, such as a checklist and important messages. This will help keep buyers informed and on top of the process.</p>
									
									<h4><strong>Other Ideas</strong></h4>
									<ul>
										<li>An AI real estate agent that alleviates most issues that arise from a real estate agent.</li>
										<li>An app that helps people find and pick houses</li>
										<ul>
											<li>This app would be a competitor of Zillow with many of the capabilities of Zillow plus the functionalities of the above extension</li>
											<li>It addresses the needs of both Newbie Ned and Investor Ivy (our persona) by helping both inexperienced and experienced buyers find and get in contact with home sellers</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>

									<h3>Idea Sketches</h3>
									<p>We sketched out each of these ideas as part of the process of specifying and eliminating to narrow down on a single, refined concept.</p>
									<img src="images/idea_sketches.png" alt="Idea Sketches" style="max-width: 100%;">
									<p>Full sketches can be found <a href="docs/idea_sketches.pdf">here</a></p>

									<h3>Evaluation</h3>
									<p>After comparing our ideas against our brief and validating that our ideas create some form of new value that does not already exist we came to the conclusion that the personalized tracker would best meet our users’ needs and add value even in the case that the user already has the help and guidance of a realtor.</p>
									<h4>The features of this approach are the following:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>A personal progress bar</li>
										<li>A task checklist</li>
										<li>Things to look out for</li>
										<li>Document/Form summarization</li>
										<li>Access to local rules and regulations</li>
										<li>Document storage</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Storyboard</h3>
									<p>Now that we were gradually narrowing down on our product idea, we attempted to chart out a user's journey through our product in an interaction flow diagram. Here is the external link to our <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNad9Oy0=/?share_link_id=969595262128">Interaction Flow</a></p>

									<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
									<p>Next, we created a low-fidelity paper prototype of our proposed product to better understand its features and test with users in co-designs.
										Images of all the interfaces of the full prototype can be found <a href="docs/paper_prototype.pdf">here</a>
									</p>
									
									<h3>Idea Testing</h3>
									<p>So far we have conducted 1 co-design session and scheduled for a second one later this week. See interview notes (externally linked) <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15g3bBVh1WCY2gFzWlAcOD5f4bPbyk1xp?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
									 <h4>Below are our key insights:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>There is already a solution to a storage locker feature currently called Docusign, so if we were to implement such a thing it would be an integration with that.</li>
										<li>The journey map would be extremely helpful especially if it included a timeline</li>
										<li>Blog name may need to be changed because blog == opinions</li>
										<li>The blog and FAQ pages are a bit cluttered and may be combined to make it more simple</li>
										<li>Love the idea of AI Chatbot</li>
										<li>Hate logging in and giving out emails. Wouldn’t especially trust this website unless from lawyer/realtor</li>
										<li>Having a module on the dashboard with relevant links to blog pages or anticipated questions would be very helpful</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Report</h3>
									<p>With everything we learned so far, we produced a report for our presumed client for this product:</p>
									<p>"Home Buddy," is a website tailored for first-time home buyers. It operates as a personalized assistant, helping users navigate the often intricate process of purchasing their first home. With a focus on organization, Home Buddy enables users to easily track important documents, notes, and specific information relevant to home buying policies in their specific area. What sets it apart is its engaging and interactive approach, complete with a personalized avatar and a custom progress bar to represent the user's position on their home buying journey, making the experience both enjoyable and motivating.</p>
									<p>Moreover, the website incorporates unique features, including an AI chatbot. This AI chatbot serves as a specialized assistant, providing answers to home-buying questions within the context of the user's account and readily available internet information. It's important to note that the chatbot is designed to complement rather than replace the guidance of a real estate agent, offering users a secondary advisory resource. In essence, Home Buddy aims to streamline and personalize the home buying experience, making it more user-friendly, engaging, and informative for first-time buyers.</p>
									<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>
									<p>Home Buddy works in two different ways. First, it acts as a generalized timeline for folks who don't have an account. In this case, the website is click based and doesn’t contain any of the user’s personal information. In the other case, the user will be prompted with a login button at the top right of the screen. By clicking this, it brings them to a page that allows them to either sign up or log in. If someone is signing up, there will be a set of questions that the website gives to start personalizing the tracker. Once an account is made and the user has answered all the questions, they will be greeted with our dashboard which contains basic information as well as the tracker. From here, there are three possible places to click that will take you to another section of the website. First, by clicking on the tracker, you will be taken to a page that has more in depth details about the current step as well as access to other steps through a click. Next, there is a documents page which holds all relevant documents that a person needs to actually purchase a house successfully. Here the documents will be separated and summarized. Lastly, the user will be able to chat with our personalized chatbot which knows the information and can help make decisions.</p>
									<h4><strong>Based on what you told us</strong></h4>
									<p>More than one user has told us that there was just so much they didn’t know about looking back on the process. They wished they had more knowledge going into home buying then they did at the time. And especially when they had a realtor, a big component of the process that they had to have was trust in their realtor as a professional who had their best interests in mind. It was hard to build that confidence on their own and have that understanding such that they could be working with their agent rather than only being able to trust their agent to guide them.</p>
									<p>Our design gives our users that confidence and control over their personal process by providing knowledge about the general process and a way to acquire knowledge unique to them and to store that personalized information all in one place. Our site explains the entire process at a high-level so users can familiarize themselves before they really start and have that prior knowledge coming in. In addition to having access to important information all in one place, they can also save and document their progress and specific information and media (signed forms and documents) all in one place for ebay reference in the future.</p>
									<p>However, users not only mentioned lack of knowledge, but also that the information they were gaining came in fast and was hard to understand. Our site presents relevant information in a way that is not overwhelming and is easy for anyone to understand not only about the general process but about forms and which agreements to expect when along with a summary of those forms and what sections are important in those documents, so users can also feel like they know what’s going and how each paper they sign fits into the process.</p>
									<p>Overall, our design meets user needs by empowering them through the process with information and easy tracking of their progress. However, it does fall short in some areas such that it cannot help them find an exact house, but instead provides prompting questions for users to know what they should look out for. Multiple users mentioned wishing they had more information about the surroundings of the house, be it natural or social. For instance one user said they wanted to find information about data for floodplains in the area they were interested in. Rather than the site providing that information or even a link to where they can find it, instead we would ask them a question like, “Is your area susceptible to certain natural disasters? If so, which ones? Which areas are safest?” There is too much weather information out there that is always changing for our site to always have that data on hand for a specific user, but we can help users know that climate in their desired area is important to consider and that they should take steps to know that information.</p>
									<h4><strong>What were other ideas?</strong></h4>
									<p>We considered many designs before we reached our current version. Here are some small but impactful designs we considered before arriving where we are now.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Different progress bars (it took many iterations to get to our current one)</li>
										<li>Including FAQ section</li>
										<li>Search bar used to be a conventional search bar</li>
										<li>Entering search area as zip code and location</li>
									</ol>
									<h4><strong>Insights</strong></h4>
									<p>We found many key insights as we have iterated on our design. We made our first insight early on in our design, which was don’t create solutions to problems that have already been solved. Our first idea helped first time homebuyers by helping them find the right home. This sounds awfully familiar to Zillow and other real estate websites and they do a pretty good job at helping buyers find the right home.</p>
									<p>After pivoting to our current design idea, we encountered our second insight: realtors are a good resource already. We kept that in mind while designing our website so that we are providing the knowledge and tools that keep buyers informed rather than outright replacing a realtor. Through our research, we found a surprisingly large amount of resources that are out there describing the process. However, there aren’t any that are both detailed and comprehensive. Because of this, we added features such as the blog and FAQ sections to provide a knowledge hub for our user group.</p>

									<h3>Effort Chart</h3>
									<p>Lastly, our effort chart reflects our individual effort in this phase. We chose a different chart
										type than last time to better present our overall contributions over that period.
