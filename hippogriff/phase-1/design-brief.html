        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, older adults who didn’t grow up with technology often find it increasingly challenging to integrate software into their daily routines. Before diving into the specific challenges faced by this user group, let’s introduce Deborah, who is the poster-child of our design brief.</p>

<p>Deborah, an 84-year-old resident of an assisted care facility, faces challenges with many software applications. While she finds it difficult to manage her emails or video call her grandchildren, she is proficient with Microsoft Word. Years ago, her grandson taught her the steps: double-click the ‘W’ icon, start a new document, type, save or print. She follows these steps religiously.</p>

<p>This routine works perfectly for Deborah when creating text documents. However, when confronted with a new task, like paying off her credit card, she’s at a loss. While many younger individuals navigate banking apps with ease, Deborah finds the signifiers and affordances of these newer cryptic interfaces foreign. She attempts to access her bank online but gets stuck at the homepage, unsure of how to log in. Despite her confidence with Word, the symbols and widgets on her bank’s interface leave her bewildered and struggling to pay off her card.</p>

<p>Many older adults are familiar with a select group of apps and tend to use them in consistent ways. However, they often struggle with new apps or computer interfaces because these designs aren’t tailored to their experiences. Designers often assume users recognize common tech symbols, like the three horizontal lines indicating a menu. But for individuals like Deborah, these symbols are unfamiliar. <strong>The issue isn’t poor design; it’s that the design doesn’t resonate with older adults’ frame of reference.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-problem--impact">The Problem &amp; Impact</h2>

<p>Technology is now integral to daily life, including for older adults who once managed fine without it. Yet, from communication to digital banking and health apps, there are assumed universal signifiers and affordances that are unfamiliar to many older adults, creating a disconnect between older users and usability.</p>

<p>Previously, we described our goal as helping introduce older adults to new technology which might better satisfy their needs. This notion was further supported after interviews with our user group, as we found that** many essential software applications, such as texting, health tracking, and finance, become inaccessible** to them–particularly when interfaces change or introduce unfamiliar features. With our new findings, we are narrowing our scope from simplifying all new technology to making essential software easier to use, such that minimal prior experience or memory is needed to navigate necessary interfaces.</p>

<p>If we are able to alleviate these barriers of confusion, we believe older adults will feel less anxiety when interacting with software needed for daily tasks.</p>

<h2 id="how-our-users-feel">How Our Users Feel</h2>

<p>Many older adults feel like technology is a useful tool but are frustrated when they can’t figure out how to achieve what they need. Some of the people we interviewed will brute force their way to a solution while others call trusted family members. We found that many older adults become so frustrated they give up while others are scared to push buttons for fear of “messing up.” Here is another illustrative story:</p>

<p>Eleanor is a grandparent who lives alone and takes weekly piano lessons over Google Meet. She has an app on her phone which she uses every day as a metronome and a tuner. Even though it’s not an intuitive interface, she knows how to use it because she uses it so frequently. She reads a physical newspaper each morning. One day, she finds a clipping from the paper that she wants to send to her piano teacher. She takes a picture with her phone, but she doesn’t know what to do next. She normally communicates with her teacher over email, which she uses on her computer. How should she attach the picture to the email, and how should she get the picture from her phone to her computer in the first place? Eleanor does what she always does in this situation: she calls her daughter Pauline.</p>

<p>Pauline lives 20 minutes away and comes over to Eleanor’s house every couple weeks to help Eleanor do something on her computer—it happens just rarely enough that Eleanor can’t remember the details of how to do it, and just rarely enough that it’s easiest to ask Pauline to come over every time. Pauline has created a set of instructions for each new task—scanning a document, attaching a file, launching her tax software, navigating to the Documents folder—which are accumulating on Eleanor’s desk as an embarrassing reminder of how many times she has had to ask for help.</p>

<p>We’ve gathered some notable quotes from several of our interactions thus far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our generation knows that we want to do something but we don’t know how to do it and we don’t know how to go about finding out how to do it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Once I get it, I know how to use it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why does my bank change its website every 3 years? I learn where everything is and then they change everything and I don’t know how to pay my bills.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[The usability of technology] should be progressing with me, not progressing beyond me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I often see symbols that I know are telling me something, but I have no idea what it is. It makes me feel stupid.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although these are direct quotes, they nonetheless reflect thoughts that we heard from multiple individuals.</p>

<h2 id="the-stakeholders">The Stakeholders</h2>

<p>Our team identified 3 sets of people groups who play a significant role in the problem we pinpointed. They are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="older-adults-65-who-struggle-with-software">Older Adults (65+) Who Struggle with Software</h3>

<p>These are our primary stakeholders and the central focus of our design project. This age group encounters the most pronounced usability challenges with technology. Many often find it difficult to adapt to new technological advancements, leading to feelings of isolation, confusion, and frustration.</p>

<h3 id="tech-helpers">Tech Helpers</h3>

<p>These individuals are the primary resources older adults turn to with tech-related queries. While they represent a diverse demographic, they are most frequently the children of older adults, caregivers, and IT support personnel. They often feel burdened or frustrated with having to repeatedly help their older adults with tech issues they see as trivial. They are also the answer to the existential question of our product: if older adults aren’t browsing for new apps to improve their experience, how will they adopt our software? Tech helpers are the ones who will introduce our product to the older adults who will use it to become more independent.</p>

<h3 id="people-who-interact-with-older-adults-through-tech">People Who Interact with Older Adults Through Tech</h3>

<p>This is the rest of the Whole Wide World that relies on digital tools to make appointments, send and receive documents, and otherwise communicate with older adults. Allowing older adults to participate fully and efficiently will make the lives easier for people who want to use technology for everything and don’t want to leave older adults behind.</p>

<h2 id="shortcomings">Shortcomings</h2>

<p>A major shortcoming of our project is that we were only given a week to conduct our user interviews. As such, we only talked to older adults we already know who live in the US. We think the people we talked to are representative of a large proportion of older adults in the US, but we didn’t talk to enough people to understand the details of their varied experience. Moreover, the experiences people shared with us may be skewed by the fact that they are mostly family members or people who know us very well. For example, they may have omitted information about their situation or experience that they thought we already knew, or they might have tended to say what they thought we wanted to hear.</p>

<p>Lastly, a lot of the experiences people shared with us fall into clichés about how older adults experience technology. It is possible that their own experience is wound up in the stereotype, and they were more willing to share the parts of their stories that matched the stereotype which would prevent us from learning how they truly interact with technology in a way that is helpful to us.</p>
