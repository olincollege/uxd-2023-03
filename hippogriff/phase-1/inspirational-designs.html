        <p>Because our user group is older adults (specifically adults who didn’t grow up with technology), it’s important for us to understand what makes existing software interfaces easy to use for this demographic. Through our experiences with older adults, including several user interviews, we’ve identified some software that older adults say they’re comfortable using on a regular basis. Here’s what we’ll take and drop from it.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-inspirations">List of Inspirations</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Plant identification apps</strong>- enables the use of a familiar interface, the phone camera, to provide information that would be difficult to google.</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook</strong>- This is an interface that many older adults use frequently and are therefore more comfortable with.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon</strong>- An intuitive search bar drives movement on the website. Although there’s a lot of intentional clutter for advertising purposes, older adults are comfortable searching for what they need and browsing the presented products.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Notes</strong>- A simple text editor that doesn’t overwhelm the user with styling options or complex features.</li>
  <li><strong>Mayo Clinic</strong>- This health website is popular with older adults both for being trustworthy and easy to navigate. While typing is certainly an option, buttons that search by the first letter of illnesses and symptoms are included as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Maps-</strong> The purpose of the website or app is so well defined that there’s only one thing you would really want to do with it—find an address. The search bar appears right away and takes you where you want to go without a fuss.</li>
  <li><strong>Zoom</strong>- Similarly to Facebook, this is an application that many older adults were forced into using over the pandemic. As a result they gained familiarity with how it works. However, due to frequent updates, the several people we interviewed said they had trouble using it now because the user interface had changed since they last used it.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Newspaper Website</strong> - The linear layout and categorization found on local newspaper websites present information in familiar, digestible chunks.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Watch</strong> - a small interface with only one or two options for what you can do on any given screen. Multiple older adults we interviewed use smart watches.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Health Apps</strong>- Connect directly to the Apple watch and send notifications through the larger display of the iPhone.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart TVs</strong>- much easier to understand compared to older TVs that require a streaming stick. A TV with integrated streaming services means both less actions are required to navigate to a desired program, and perhaps more importantly that a button can’t be pressed to change the video input and become stuck.</li>
  <li><strong>Solitaire</strong>- A digitized version of a real game. Utilizes skeuomorphism by having realistic playing cards.** **</li>
  <li><strong>Kindle</strong>- Kindle’s built-in dictionary and limited features shows how technology can provide immense value while maintaining minimal design.</li>
  <li><strong>iMessage</strong>- With its large text display and clear separation of conversation threads, iMessage is a great example of how communicating through technology can be made easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Superhuman</strong> - Email application ultra-optimized for efficiency that reminds users how to do actions quickly as they are needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Alexa</strong>- Voice activation can allow older adults to command technology without the complicated barriers of screens and buttons.</li>
  <li><strong>Netflix</strong>- Ideally a one stop shop for all streaming needs. The more that’s on one app the easier it is to find everything. This is becoming less of an advantage in recent years.</li>
</ul>

<p>You probably haven’t heard of Superhuman, but they boast users at the helm of companies like Spotify, Netflix, Notion, Uber, and even Harvard; and that it saves teams 10,000,000 hours per year. Those are some bold claims. Especially when it costs $30/month – $360/year.</p>

<p>But, those companies are headed by young CEOs - Spotify’s Daniel Ek is a mere 40, Greg Peters guides Netflix with 49 hardy years of life experience, and Notion’s Ivan Zhao is a spring chicken at 35. None of those men are older adults– and Superhuman knows this. Superhuman is keyboard-driven (something we specifically noticed older adults struggle with), has a simple, icon-based user interface (another struggle we identified), and its iPad experience pales in comparison to its desktop interface.</p>

<p>But its design and user experience is slick as a bowling alley, and it seamlessly allows you to learn keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow.</p>

<p>C for compose. Simple enough. R for reply, gotcha. Command+K opens the (k)ommand bar, sure. Command+Shift+,(comma) to discard draft? Woah, what? But, don’t worry: hover over the trash icon and Superhuman reminds you:</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/superhuman-1.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>
      Superhuman’s tooltips in action

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>This comes back to our discovery that older adults have trouble working with the keyboard in general: rather than avoiding the keyboard and focusing purely on visual cues, Superhuman finds the perfect balance; showing the keyboard shortcut to those who want to know, and keeping a physical analogy (trash this draft = trash can). Also, this animation is super fast compared to normal hover tags, meaning it addresses the discovery that buttons aren’t always clear: hover over anything and (nearly) instantly get a text description. But, the magic really comes when you use the visual cue:</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/superhuman-2.png" alt="" /><figcaption>
      C for cool, too?

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Superhuman reminds you of keyboard shortcuts when you <em>don’t</em> use them, hinting you over time. This addresses another discovery of ours: when older adults don’t use things (features, shortcuts, menus, etc.), they forget. Superhuman solves this by reminding you.</p>

<p>Finally, Superhuman hits another of our other discoveries: older adults’ fondness of all-encompassing guides. Superhuman offers a <a href="https://download.superhuman.com/Superhuman%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts.pdf">giant PDF user guide</a> with every single keyboard shortcut that can be printed and kept on a wall, so if you’re looking for a function, you never have to memorize it. We’ll keep these lessons in mind as we build.</p>

<h3 id="kats-notes-about-apple-notes">Kat’s Notes About Apple Notes</h3>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/apple-notes-1.png" alt="" /><figcaption>
      Hello world, 10-4

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Apple’s default notes app is a staple of the Apple Ecosystem. An undeniable factor that contributes to the default notes app’s popularity is exactly that, it’s the default software installed on iPhones, Macs, and iPads- a cult favorite of older adults. Being a default app also means that there are never any confusing or distracting pop-ups or banners for ads or subscription offers, all of which can be overwhelming and confusing for older users.</p>

<p>With this in mind, there are still some underlying design choices that make this app a better experience for older adults. The attractiveness of this app is that advanced features are mostly hidden away until needed.</p>

<p>Upon creating a new note, the keyboard pops up and the cursor immediately starts blinking. The first line is formatted with a recognizable title format (bold, larger font,) and acts as the title of the note. Without having to manually switch modes, all subsequent lines will be body text which, in most cases, is all that is ever needed. This simple and fundamental functionality covers the majority of use cases. Although more complex features are included, nothing further is needed to effectively use the app.</p>

<p>That’s not to say there aren’t well designed additional tools. There are several simple signifiers, intentionally colored with a noticeable yellow, at the top right of the screen.</p>

<p>Under the first icon, signified with the characters Aa, are standard formatting tools such as headings, bold text, bullets, etc. The next two icons, the checklist and table, don’t require any sort of submenu. Onced tapped they insert the desired element directly into the note. While the stylization of these elements isn’t customizable, it doesn’t need to be. Instead, the desired functions are accessed with minimal interaction. Menus that lead into other menus or submenus with an abundance of superfluous options were often cited in our interviews as stressful and frustrating. This minimalist approach cuts down on this issue significantly.</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/apple-notes-2.jpeg" alt="" /><figcaption>
      Format undercover

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Furthermore, these first three icons correspond to the features that our users expressed they used the most. Specifically, the checklist is very popular for shopping and todo lists.</p>

<p>The file structure of the notes app takes a similar approach to simplicity that can be expanded into more functionality as needed. By default all notes are stored in a single folder. More folders can be created if the user wishes for more advanced organization, but understanding and organizing this isn’t needed to use the app. All notes are sorted in the sidebar by the date most recently edited. A search tool is also included in this sidebar which can easily be used to find specific notes.</p>

<p>This format means that old notes can be forgotten about without creating clutter while relevant notes stay at the top. Notes don’t need to be organized into file structures or notebooks or sections. Old notes don’t have to be deleted, new notes can just keep being created, and everything is still easy to find.</p>

<p>In our design work this semester we want to create a similar model of stripped, aesthetic, intuitive simplicity. We want to only include features that are important and we don’t want to present them in an overwhelming way. Although it could be a challenge, we want our application to be able to scale with our users in the same way that the Apple notes app works just as well for users who use advanced elements and formatting as it does for users who have no mental model of how that works and just start typing into a note.</p>

<h3 id="kristin-on-kindle">Kristin on Kindle</h3>

<p>We exist in an era where technology is defined by its endless features, making it easy for the user experience to take a backseat. This oversight becomes even more pronounced for older adults who might find themselves navigating an alien landscape with each new device. Yet, in this complex digital ecosystem, Amazon’s Kindle emerges as a rare example of thoughtful design.</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/kindle-1.png" alt="" /><figcaption>
      K for Kindling, too?

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>The first thing that strikes you about the Kindle is its refreshing simplicity. Unlike devices that overwhelm users with a multitude of functions (many of which remain untouched), the Kindle embraces a return-to-basics philosophy. With intuitive gestures mimicking the act of reading a physical book – a swipe to turn a page, a tap to access the library – it offers convenience without abandoning the familiar. In this way, it bridges the gap, providing a comfortable digital reading experience reminiscent of traditional books.</p>

<p>But what elevates the Kindle beyond just being user-friendly is its instant dictionary feature. Think about those moments when you’re immersed in a novel and then suddenly encounter a word that leaves you puzzled. With the Kindle, deciphering that word is as simple as a press-and-hold. Imagine applying this utility to other tech contexts. For example, picture Grandma tapping on words like “Cloud” or “Streaming” and getting instant, jargon-free info. Many older adults have shared with our team that they often feel thrown off by unfamiliar tech lingo, so they could benefit immensely from a tool that demystifies terms on the go.</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/kindle-2.png" alt="" /><figcaption>
      Dictionary, demystify

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Additionally, the Kindle’s onboarding process is nothing short of graceful. New device introductions can be daunting for many, but the Kindle’s built-in tutorials strike the right balance. They’re present, ready to guide when needed, but they don’t impose. It’s similar to having a patient teacher by your side, assuring you that there’s no rush, and you can learn at your own pace. This respect for the user’s journey, especially for those who might not be digital natives, is a significant nod to inclusivity in design.</p>

<p>Kindle’s intuitive features are incredibly inspiring for our team. As we shape our future designs, we will be sure to draw from Kindle’s simplicity and elegance.</p>

<h3 id="coles-words-on-word">Cole’s Words on Word</h3>

<p>Throughout our interviews, time and time again we saw older adults saying that one of the few technologies they use is Microsoft Word. Admittedly, this is not a huge surprise. We’ve all seen grandparents use it to type up instructions or keep a list of some important information. What might not be so familiar is why Word has become a normal part of their tech tool box.</p>

<p>The primary factor for its wide adoption is because many people used it as an integral part of their job. One of our insights is that older adults struggle to learn new technology because it’s frustrating that it’s so easy for everyone else to use, but difficult for them to pick up. Obviously this annoyance does not foster a helpful learning mindset, and can artificially increase the perceived difficulty of understanding any tech. Fortunately (or unfortunately), when you’re at work, many things are incredibly frustrating, but you are of course still responsible for completing whatever task you’re given. This means that many older adults were forced to learn how to adopt this tool into their workflow.</p>

<p>This touches on another insight: Our people group has a small set of tasks or tools (related to tech) that they use, and they pretty much <strong>only</strong> use those. Because they already know how to use Word, they continue to use it. When interviewing one of the residents of an assisted living facility I used to volunteer at, he told me that he uses Word for a multitude of things. Writing letters to his family, printing instructions on how to connect to the Wifi, tracking a todo list, etc. Some of these tasks work great with a document editor, but a todo list would be much better suited on a device you keep on you at all times, and where you can easily add/remove tasks. He expressed frustration about those exact considerations, but he already knows how to use Word, and the barrier to entry of learning an entirely new tool simply outweighs the benefit he thinks he’d gain.</p>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/word-1.png" alt="" /><figcaption>
      The first words are always the hardest

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Admittedly, Word is not a foreign concept to our people group. Word is a computer’s analogy of a type writer and much of its UI is reminiscent of older technology that people are familiar with. The save icon is a floppy disk. When you press a key on your keyboard, it shows straight up on the screen exactly as you typed it. When you open up Word, it shows you your last used documents. It’s a very linear process that’s easy to follow. Everything that happens on screen is the result of a direct action the user took. These things resonate well with older adults because the context they had for interacting with technology in their youth was much more simple. Super complex screens displaying 100 options at once (most of which are just symbols) just wasn’t what they used 30-40 years ago.</p>

<p>Observing how older adults use Word and hearing their thoughts about it will give us a great foundation to begin thinking about considerations that should go into our product design.</p>

<h3 id="ian-watches-smart-watches">Ian Watches Smart Watches</h3>

<figure class="">
  <img src="/uxd-2023-03/hippogriff/images/inspirational-designs/apple-watch-1.png" alt="" /><figcaption>
      Small device, big impact

    </figcaption></figure>

<p>Ian has never owned an Apple product, nor have they ever used a wearable. Still, based on rave reviews from one of the older adults they interviewed, they decided to check out an Apple Watch for this profile. The thing is a technological marvel.</p>

<p>Sarah (a pseudonym) uses her smart watch to track her steps, sleep, and heart rate throughout the day. She likes the interface because there’s nothing to it—the interface only affords one or two actions at a time, a constraint driven by the small size of the screen and single external button. She knows how to navigate to what she needs, and if she miss-clicks, it’s easy to go back to the previous screen by pressing the physical button. If the only mapping you know is that the button signifies ‘go back,’ then already you will be less afraid to experiment and can avoid decision paralysis.</p>

<p>Touching the screen provides instant haptic feedback to the wearer’s wrist. The home screen has app symbols identical to those on a phone, which provides a familiar conceptual model for the user. Unlike a phone, Fabio (another pseudonym) says he never needs to scroll through pages of apps, because all the functions he uses it for will fit on the default home screen. This is a reminder for us to make all of the standard options visible at one time (to avoid burying information in menus where it will never be found), and to trim down the functions to only the essentials, because more will create clutter while going unused.</p>

<p>The reason I call Apple’s smart watch a technological marvel is because it is integrated seamlessly with the phone to extend the device’s presence into even more of your sensory systems. Playing music on your Airpods? You can control it from your wrist. Leave your phone behind on the subway? Your watch will vibrate to alert you that it’s not on your body. There’s one last touch I have to mention: rotating the knob on the button scrolls the screen up and down; no need to swipe with a finger. The top of the knob is flush with the top of the screen, marking a natural signifier for what rolling it forwards or backwards might do.</p>
