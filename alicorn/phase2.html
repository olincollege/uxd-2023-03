          <h3>Introducing AniMap</h3>
          <p>
            AniMap is a platform for animators to build and discover local
            communities. It`s a centralized platform to foster connections
            between animators in both a social and professional capacity. The
            website allows users to find other nearby animators, fostering
            social and professional connections. This also helps create a space
            where new animators can easily access a community for support. A big
            problem is that animation can be a very isolating career and it can
            have a barrier of high activation energy for people to connect with
            one another. By consolidating information about animation-related
            events in one place, it simplifies the process of finding and
            attending events. This reduces the effort and time required to
            discover these opportunities.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            On the homepage of AniMap, users will be presented with a map of the
            world and a text box to enter more specific information regarding
            their location (ie. zip code or city name). Once the site has
            filtered search results to their preferred location, pins will
            appear on the map of that area representing different local animator
            profiles and event descriptions. There will also be an option to
            toggle a list version of this information. A user can hover over the
            different pins and get a short summary of the profile or event. If
            the user is interested in the pin, they can then click to get an
            expanded version with more detailed information. Profiles and event
            descriptions will have different pin images so they are easy to
            distinguish. On each profile, there will be information about the
            animator and what they're interested in as well as their preferred
            method of contact. Clicking on event pins will show a description of
            the event and any RSVP details/requirements.

          <p>
            This page design stems from the information we collected in user
            interviews and research. Animation can be a very siloed career,
            especially for newer or independent animators who may not be working
            with a large studio or group. The idea isn't to recreate the
            existing value provided by social media (ie. creating online
            communities) but rather create in-person connections with other
            animators in a way that social media currently doesn't. This also
            helps create a space of new animators to find strong local
            communities and seek connections with peers/mentors nearby. Overall,
            the site creates a place that consolidates information about events
            and animators while reducing the activation energy needed for
            animators to start building or expanding their communities.
          </p>

            user interest, animation style, and software expertise
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of facilitating connection, this design meets that in some
            ways but falls short in others. For example, it's very effective in
            terms of creating one place for people to look rather than needing
            to sort through tons of social media pages or hear things via word
            of mouth. However, the site itself functions more like an
            information database, it doesn't address the problems around
            actually planning or creating events for animators to attend. That
            being said, providing space both for individual connections along
            with joining a larger community makes it so that our site is fairly
            versatile in fulfilling the needs of people who are in different
            stages in their careers or have different interests.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <p>
            The design we have been elaborating so far ties in to the personas
            we have constructed to better understand the user group we are
            designing for. Having had more contact with animators, we focused on
            making something appealing to what we saw as the most common traits
            that different animators, or people in the business of animation
            would like. Our persona, Indie Sock is supposed to represent the
            average independent animator, whose goal is to create their own
            self-sustaining business through their passion:
          </p>

          <ul class="actions">
            <li><img width="250" src="images/indie_sock.png" /></li>
            <li>
              <div>
                For Indie Sock, AniMap is an incredibly exciting tool as this
                will enable them to more easily find both community and
                collaborators that are local. This is important for an
                independent animator's early career, as a lot of the business
                that occurs in the scene is usually through mutual and personal
                connection. This is also something that is very appealing to the
                next persona, Career Carrie:
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="actions">
            <li><img width="250" src="images/career_carrie.png" /></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Similarly to Sock, Carrie's interest in AniMap comes from their
                desire to kick start their animation career by both showing off
                their work and being able to find other potential work and
                connections though the website. Just as independent animation a
                lot of the times works through informal trust relations,
                successful careers in animation also rely on a person's network
                and portfolio. This leads us to the final persona, Producer P.:
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="actions">
            <li>
              <img width="250" src="images/producer_p.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It is a producer's job to organize the financial and logistical
                aspects of almost any large scale production. To this end,
                producers are often tasked with finding and hiring the
                animators, voice-actors, and possibly even directors of large
                products. It is also common for producers to want to find local
                artists as this will make the logistics significantly easier.
                AniMap enables Producers to quickly and easily find animators
                (and potential other roles that are still in development) that
                are both local and reputable due to their portfolio being
                public. For a producer, having the ability to locate and find
                groups of people easily would make their life a lot easier. On
                the animators side, knowing that having a portfolio in AniMap
                could lead to them being hired, incentivises a diverse set of
                animators to use the website and keep it alive and thriving.
              </p>

          <h3>Alternatives We Considered</h3>

            <strong>Figure:</strong> Above is an annotated sketch model of the
            Animator's Cafe booking page based on blender. One could design the
            space using the typical blender workflow. Once they have their spice
            designed they can use the timeline utility at the bottom of the
            screen to finalize their booking. Below is a sketch model of the
            Re-animate website. The sketch shows the main project page which is
            the page shown to users after they have selected a re-animate
            project to be a part of.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image1.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The other two ideas we focused on were an Animator's Cafe and a site
            called Re-Animate (both shown above). The Animator's Cafe idea was
            about creating a permanent space for animators to co-work or
            socialize. The site would be structured like common animation tools
            so booking space in the cafe would feel very similar to animating
            and be a more engaging platform than just booking a time slot. The
            Re-Animate site focused on the idea that one way animators connect
            with each other is by working on reanimation projects where a group
            of animators each take a section of a piece of media and re-create
            it in their style and then all the clips are strung together. This
            is an interesting opportunity for an animator to both work on their
            own skills but also collaborate and socialize with other animators.
            The site would focus on organization of these events so that it's
            easier to access with wider reach. We ended up going with the AniMap
            idea for a few different reasons. The main reason is that we found
            that there isn't a lack of community events and opportunities to
            socialize; the main block seems to be the ability to share this
            information. The young, independent animators we talked to enjoy
            going to events for animators and socializing. They even feel
            confident that they could arrange their own event if they wanted. As
            a result, we believe that we don't need to facilitate the type of
            interaction that fosters connection between animators, we just need
            to aid the process animators find out about others.

            we would primarily pursue for this phase, and create co design

          </p>
          <h3>Feedback from Users & Design Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            In both interviewing, and co-designing, we learned a lot about not
            only the function of interfaces for artists and animators, but about
            the importance of form, and playful design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first codesigner was a young, independent, early-career animator
            from the Detroit area who we'll be referring to using the pseudonym
            “Fall”. We presented Fall our three main ideas (Re-animate,
            Animator's Space, and AniMap). Fall did not like the Animator's
            Space. She felt the quirky interface for booking space based on
            standard animation software was intimidating and would very likely
            scare a lot of animators away from the space. She also emphasized
            the importance of efficiency when it comes to using these tools that
            requires a lot of customization. She felt that people would not want
            to go through the hassle of either applying their customizations or
            re-learning the defaults in order to book the space through our
            website. On the other hand, Fall liked the Re-animate idea the best.
            Fall had participated in some re-animate projects before and really
            understood the added value of having a tool like the Re-animate
            website to aid with organizing the project. Fall also really enjoyed
            the AniMap idea. Fall saw the value in having a fun and interactive
            database with information for animators but felt that it lacked some
            of the fun that surrounded the Re-animate website. Fall suggested
            that adding a community bulletin board to the website could be a fun
            way to engage website visitors more. The community bulletin board
            could be an interactive portion of the website that presents local
            events in your area. Seeing the bulletin board update with fun new
            events and shoutouts could be a reason to come back to the website
            and engage with it in ways that don't feel like searching for
            something on Google. A possible implementation of the bulletin board
            based on Fall's specifications can be seen in the figure below. The
            figure below also contains some other suggestions from summer like
            having a scrolling profile that allows you to display pictures in
            addition to videos.

          <p>
            In our second co-design we were able to meet physically, with a
            local boston independent animator, who we'll call by a pseudonym of
            “Bug”. We took several paper prototypes, scissors, and sticky notes
            to a south station cafe, and got to dive into the nitty gritty of
            the form and function of the user interfaces. We were able to take
            the idea of a physical pinboard proposed by our first co designer,
            and get sketches of fun and playful ways to bring this interface to
            life. Shown below, our co-designer came up with 3D telephone poles
            with stabled flyers, a store front window, a cork board with digital
            push pins, and even a page cluttered with popups to wade through.

          </p>
          <p>
            For Bug, one thing that animators are directly attracted to is
            visual intrigue, and attention to detail. Bug wanted to see
            interesting sound effects, and skeuomorphic visual features. Bug
            also suggested borrowing squash and stretch animation principles to
            guide motion of UI elements on the site. While for many user groups,
            these could potentially add clutter, almost all animators we spoke
            to have a highly visual workflow, and are accustomed to and even
            enjoy some artful visual complexity. Animation learning and blog
            sites like https://ingoraschka.com/ (bright colors/ motion warning!)
            are a prime example of how animators have formed their own niche web
            interface styles that fly in the face of websites trending to
            simpler and simpler forms of themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bug was also excited about highlighting the creativity of animators
            on AniMap, and expressed a desire for further structured
            customization of profile pages. Shown below, Bug had several ideas
            including being able to create your own rigged character that could
            wander your page, uploading background gifs and images, draggable
            profile elements to customize the layout, and suggested looking to
            <a href="https://www.gaiaonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >gaia online</a
            >
            for inspiration, a forum based communication platform.

            customization of the map
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, Bug enjoyed our core features, such as searchability, and
            thought tag categories were great and helpful, as well as artist
            bios and demo reels. But Bug really emphasized something we've heard
            in other interviews as well, which is that visual playfulness is
            important when designing with and for artists and animators. These
            values align closely with the hobbyist hannah persona, as well as
            indie sock, who both enjoy artistic fulfillment and love of the
            craft above all else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bug also secondarily enjoyed the animators space and reanimate
            projects, because he believed they both were tools missing from the
            toolkit of animators and organizers. But he also wished they could
            somehow be incorporated into the map, as part of a border toolkit of
            social media meant for animators. Bug enjoyed the concept of a
            visual interface matching animation software tools, but stressed the
            importance of choice, and that unless lots of different softwares
            were covered, someone might feel left out.

          <p>
            One of the things that came up multiple times in our user research
            and interviews with a few independent animators is that animation
            can be a very lonely career. In response, our team is focusing on
            ideas that not only promote connection but facilitate the process in
            some way to make it easier. All of our ideas act as a hub for
            animators to gather, explore, and meet other animators. As a result,
            we expect to have large quantities of data available on all of our
            ideas whether it is lists of animators or lists of events. One of
            the most important features our designs will share is how the user
            will filter/search through this data. Filtering and searching will
            manifest very differently for each idea. In the following pages,
            you'll get to explore how searching/filtering plays into each idea.
