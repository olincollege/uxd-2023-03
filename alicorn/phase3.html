          <h2>What Is Animap</h2>
          <p>
            AniMap is a database of animators, events related to animation, and
            resources for animators. All of the data stored on AniMap is tied to
            a location. When searching for anything on the website, it displays
            the information on a map. The purpose of this is to help connect
            local animators to each other and foster in-person relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site opens to a search bar which the user can type their request
            into with a few commonly searching tags below it. Most of the site
            revolves around this search feature and its corresponding map. Our
            concept is to allow users to search for profiles or events that may
            be related to their interests and then giving them a map of where
            these people/events are in relation to them. The goal of our design
            is to create a simple interface to find this kind of information but
            not necessarily be a social media platform where people can contact
            one another online. AniMap's emphasis on creating in-person
            relationships is why there's only a search method but not a built-in
            feature to chat with another user.

          <h2>The Evolution of Our Prototype</h2>

          <h3>Our Initial Paper Prototype</h3>

          <p>
            For our user group specifically, that being animators and other
            similar creatives, aesthetics cohesion is of utmost importance. We
            wanted our website to feel familiar, casual, and a little DIY. This
            is reflected in our paper prototype which is shown below.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image9.png" />
          </div>

          <p style="text-align: center">
            <strong>Figure:</strong> Our initial paper prototype.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our paper prototype established some important design ideas that we
            wanted to maintain in our Figma prototype. One of those ideas was
            placing the earth in the center of the homepage with a search bar
            on-top. This is supposed to signify that a user can “search the
            world” for other users while emphasizing that animators are
            everywhere and even though an animator might feel isolated, they
            aren't alone. Another idea was that we wanted our idea to feel
            joyful and playful. One design element where this idea manifests
            itself is our font.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall it was a nice way to start this design, but there were a lot
            of things missing. Most importantly, the design felt bare and there
            was still a lot of missing functionality
          </p>

          <h3>Figma Prototype #1</h3>

          <p>
            Our first Figma prototype was supposed to be a proof-of-conecept of
            our paper prototype as a Figma prototype. We now had a few more
            buttons for the extra functionality we had thought of at this point,
            but there was a lot wrong with this version. This design seems like
            a website from the 90's about the future, which is far off from the
            aesthetic sensibilities of our user group and the aesthetic designs
            established in our paper prototype. The star-trek-esque font, the
            neon green text color, and the dark background, made our design feel
            sterile and boring. We decided to hit the drawing board again and
            make a new Figma prototype. This time we wanted to focus on
            revamping the visual design of the website while maintaining the
            functionality added in our first Figma prototype.
          </p>

          <p>
            This version harkens back to the original paper prototype, though it
            also has quite a lot of user walkthrough feedback incorporated in
            it. It is a full redesign that trades the clean and sterile design
            of the previous version for a noisy, cluttered, and energetic
            aesthetic. We include Animan, an idea from the original drawing that
            is supposed to be like a DIY clippy a user can edit. There is a bit
            of a torn paper aesthetic, which draws from the literal paper
            prototype and is supposed to look like an animator's scattered
            scratch paper. We also decided on a more firm tetradic color scheme
            that was color blind friendly, based mostly in pastels, though for
            this version, the scheme seemed to get lost towards the edges of the
            document. This was the prototype we submitted to the heuristic
            evaluation which means we got a lot of feedback on the design. All
            the feedback, discussed later in the report, lead us to our final
            prototype.

          <p>
            Based on the feedback that we had received, we decided to try to
            find an aesthetic middle ground between the loud and poppy previous
            design and the more tame and sterile first design. We address the
            color cohesion issues by restricting our color palette to something
            more near analogous green-blue rather than the more complex tetradic
            scheme we had tried to use all over before. To make the analogous
            colors pop more, there are more high and low contrast regions on the
            document, having the background be a more neutral blue so that the
            world pops out, and using negative and positive space to separate
            and emphasize the title text. We also changed the font, especially
            radically changing the non-header font so that it would read more
            professionally. Overall this design trades in the loud, obnoxious,
            and off-the-wall design of the last prototype for a creative,
            harmonious, yet still energetic design.

          <h2>What did we learn?</h2>

          <h3>Feedback from cognitive walkthroughs & heuristic evaluations</h3>

          <p>
            We got a lot of feedback through our codesigns to place importance
            on creating a site that felt familiar to animators, something that
            contained exciting colors and animations. We chose to take
            inspiration from some of the sites our users had enjoyed as
            children. As a result, we tried to make our visual design feel
            whimsical and fun. However, in our heuristic evaluations, we
            realized that we may have gone too far to one side of the spectrum
            where the site was almost too childish. Specifically, it made people
            looking at our site feel like they weren't being taken seriously and
            that they were on a site intended for kids. This taught us a
            valuable lesson in figuring out what's the right balance of more
            interesting design choices that we think our user group might like
            and traditional site design to provide some familiarity for people.
          </p>

          <p>
            In both our heuristic evaluation and cognitive walk through
            feedback, we were told that exploring the search results was a
            difficult task. There were a lot of icons all over the screen and it
            wasn't easy to figure out what they meant. That meant that it was
            difficult to figure out what you were supposed to click on as a
            user. The reason for this confusion was clear. Our team had story
            boarded out many possibilities for how search results could be
            displayed to the user and rather than picking just one from our
            prototype we used elements from all of them. Rather than improving
            our design, this actually made our design harder to use. Our
            solution to this was to follow Jakob's Law which suggests that users
            will spend a majority of their time on other websites which means
            that they'd prefer your website to work in the same way. We ended up
            modeling the search results page more closely on the search results
            page of Google Maps. This meant displaying pins on a map that
            correspond to search results that are listed in a separate section.

          <h3>Improving Teaming Skills</h3>

          <p>
            To be honest, one of the key insights we got out of this phase was
            not at all about our prototype or design but rather around the
            teaming aspects of our project. We went through a few different of
            team management and spent much of this time figuring out what works
            best for that. We learned that it's important to resolve teaming
            issues directly so that we're able to move forward and work together
            more efficiently.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another insight we got through this phase was how to navigate having
            multiple design directions on one team. We initially tried to have
            people work on different parts of the same prototype but quickly
            realized that when we did that there wasn't cohesiveness between the
            two designs, especially after our heuristic evaluation. This brought
            us to the question of whether it is better for all of us to work on
            one prototype or increase our workload and work on two different
            prototypes with different visions. We realized that despite feeling
            like it would slow us down, the quality of our work would be better
            if we had two prototypes with cohesive designs instead of one
            prototype that was an amalgamation of styles. Once we had two
            complete prototypes we took the time to decide what we liked from
            each to create our final prototype.
          </p>

          <p>
            After our heuristic review, we also learnt a lot about how to parse
            through feedback. For example, a piece of feedback we got was that
            including the Date of Birth as a signup field felt odd to them as
            most sites nowadays require that you only give your name and email.
            While our initial reaction was to take the feedback and immediately
            change things, the more we thought about it the more we felt like
            that field was valuable and we didn't communicate that very well to
            our reviews. The reason the field existed in the first place is
            because the primary purpose of our site is to encourage people to
            meet up in person with others. Encouraging minors to meet up with
            adults could potentially be a really big problem which is why we
            wanted some age restrictions. It was incredibly important for us to
            be able to think through the different feedback and be able to
            justify why we didn't agree with some of it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="next" class="main">
          <h2>What's next?</h2>

          <p>
            Going forward, we have a few different things that we still need to
            answer. In our current prototype, we've only implemented the profile
            search so the primary question we need to ask ourselves is how are
            we going to differentiate between profiles, events, and resources in
            a way that's easy for our users to understand but also doesn't lead
            to an overly cluttered page. We also want to do more investigation
            into coloring and see if there's a way we can keep the fun and
            colorful vibe of the site while making it more cohesive and less
            busy with all the different colors. Although this isn't a graphic
            design class, through our interviews with different animators, we've
            found that this is an aspect of user experience that they greatly
            value which means that we also want to understand and make our site
            a pleasant experience for them to utilize.
