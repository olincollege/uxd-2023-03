          <h2>What Is Animap</h2>
          <p>
            AniMap is a database of people working in animation, events related
            to animation, and resources for animators. It was designed to serve
            early career animators, producers, directors, and others working in
            the field of animation. Through conversations with animators, we
            learned that producing, creating, and distributing a feature length
            animation takes a team of people working together. However, early
            career animators can have trouble building their network and finding
            opportunities. This feeling is amplified by the isolating nature of
            drawing animations which typically happens alone. To address these
            issues, our team designed a platform meant to connect local
            animators to each other and foster in-person relationships.
          </p>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            AniMap attempts to aid in-person connections by helping animators
            find other animators in their area. All the data stored in AniMap's
            database is tied to a location and searching for information is done
            similarly to how one might find a restaurant on Google Maps.
          </p>
          <h2>Why is it the right option?</h2>
          <p>
            The problem we are hoping to solve is not a new issue for animators.
            A lot of animators currently use social media as a way to
            self-advertise. However, there are a lot of issues with using social
            media. Getting the right people to view your pages on social media
            can be a complicated and confusing task since algorithms for these
            platforms are changing constantly to meet the needs of larger
            companies advertising on the same platforms. This is the main
            difference between AniMap and other social media platforms. AniMap
            is designed to be another tool in an animator's toolkit. It is
            designed to be easy and intuitive to use centered entirely on the
            needs of animators. It lacks unnecessary features and aligns with
            the design philosophies of other tools used by animators.

        <section id="insights" class="main">
          <h2>How we landed on our final design</h2>

          <h3>Insight #1: Parallel Development</h3>

          <p>
            Another insight we got through this phase was how to navigate having
            multiple design directions on one team. We initially tried to have
            people work on different parts of the same prototype but quickly
            realized that when we did that there wasn't cohesiveness between the
            two designs, especially after our heuristic evaluation. This brought
            us to the question of whether all of us should work on one prototype
            or increase our workload and work on two different prototypes with
            different visions. We realized that despite feeling like it would
            slow us down, the quality of our work would be better if we had two
            prototypes with cohesive designs instead of one prototype that was
            an amalgamation of styles. Once we had two complete prototypes we
            took the time to decide what we liked from each to create our final
            prototype. This process made A/B testing especially useful toward
            the end of the phase since now our test could encompass our two
            functionally equal yet aesthetically different designs, and give us
            a clear favorite. Doing the A/B testing, it quickly became
            transparent that the Animators had preferences that favored our
            cleaner, more modern design.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was for many reasons, the most important of which was their
            perception of applications that animators already use as tools. The
            fun throwback design might have had some initial intrigue in our
            early testing, but when faced with it and what seems like a more
            functional, professional UI, they unilaterally chose the latter.
            This is when we realized how important our parallel development had
            been. Early on, like most designers do, we projected a little too
            much of our preconceived notions of animators on our personas. Due
            to this, when we got to testing around halfway through the semester,
            there was a growing dissatisfaction with our current design.
            Parallel development and A/B testing, let us put our preconceived
            notions to the test versus the feedback the animators and classmates
            were giving us. Ultimately, let the animators choose what design
            they found more satisfying to what we think are good results.
          </p>

          <h3>Insight #2: Inspirations</h3>

          <p>
            Since we had decided to have a map interface as the primary
            interface of our site, we knew we wanted to draw inspiration from
            other sites that are also location-based. Based on Jakob's law,
            users will spend most of their time on other sites, we looked at
            several sites that use map interfaces in a way similar to ours using
            pins to represent different locations and allowing users to search
            through them based on what they're looking for. One of the sites we
            drew a lot of inspiration from was Google Maps. An issue we found
            was trying to display a large amount of information in a way that
            was accessible to our user, but that's a problem that Google Maps
            has handled really well so we modeled parts of our UI after their
            interface. Things like having a list view of results in the sidebar
            but also having them as pins on the map to see their respective
            orientations were something that we pulled from Google Maps.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we created our initial paper prototype, we wanted to keep
            things as general as possible so that the user would have more
            flexibility in their searches. However, we realised that openness
            could be a double-edged sword. We wanted to find a way for users who
            don't have specific searches in mind to not feel intimidated while
            keeping the function fairly generalised. When looking at Google
            Maps, we realised a really helpful feature there was creating tag
            categories where commonly searched tags are displayed and a user can
            simply click that button to initiate a search. We chose to implement
            this in our later versions to solve the original problem of being
            too flexible while always adhering to the laws of UX since many
            people are familiar with the categories interface on Google Maps.
          </p>

          <h3>Insight #3: It's a tool not a social media</h3>

          <p>
            We figured out early on in our user research that there's no desire
            for (yet another) social media site as a means of connection. Many
            different platforms aid in creating online connections and
            friendships but we found that our users wanted to have more
            in-person connections. There was a general sentiment of animators
            having a lonely career path where most of their time is spent
            drawing/animating on their own. As we began designing our site, we
            realised that it lends itself really well to a chatting feature. We
            give people all these different profiles and event options but don't
            provide a built-in way of communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was something we wrestled with because we knew that adding a
            chat would make it easier for our users to connect but it would also
            encourage more online connection. When do you compromise your user
            experience for your mission? While we knew that leaving out the
            messaging aspect might lose us some users who feel that the site
            isn't convenient, we decided that to stay true to our original
            mission and what we heard were the pain points of our users, we
            would need to sacrifice that aspect of the site. This is the way we
            ensured that our site remained a tool for our users rather than
            taking the place of social media as a communication platform.
          </p>
          <h3>Insight #4: Parallel Development</h3>

          <p>
            The last major insight we garnered was about striking the right
            balance between a formal and playful design. This insight emerged
            from our user feedback, where animators expressed the need for a
            professional platform, yet also desired a touch of creativity
            reflecting their artistic industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the world of animation, professionalism is key, but so is
            creativity and innovation. Our initial designs leaned heavily
            towards a more playful and whimsical aesthetic, mirroring the
            imaginative nature of animation. However, user feedback suggested
            that this approach, while visually appealing, did not instill a
            sense of professional reliability. Animators, especially those in
            the early stages of their career, are looking for platforms that are
            not only inspiring but also serious and functional for professional
            growth and networking.
          </p>

          <p>
            To address this, we iterated on our design to create a more balanced
            interface. We incorporated cleaner lines, a more subdued color
            palette, and structured layouts to bring a sense of professionalism.
            Simultaneously, we retained elements of creativity through the use
            of animation-inspired iconography, dynamic shapes, and a more
            vibrant color scheme in selected areas of the interface. This
            harmonized approach caters to both the professional needs and the
            artistic sensibilities of our users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through this balance, AniMap stands out from conventional
            professional networking platforms, which often lack a creative
            flair, and from purely artistic platforms, which might miss the mark
            on professional networking needs. Our design now effectively
            communicates that AniMap is a serious tool for professional growth,
            yet one that understands and celebrates the unique creativity of the
            animation industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            This insight was crucial in shaping AniMap into a platform that
            animators find relatable and useful, bridging the gap between a
            professional network and a creative community, thereby fulfilling
            our mission to support and empower animators at every stage of their
            career.

          <div style="text-align: center">

              If you're interested in reading more of the feedback we got from
              our heuristic feedback, check out the documentation here:

            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Based on the feedback that you received during the Design Refinement
            phase, including the Heuristic Evaluation review, we made many
            different changes. We've organized this in response to each of the
            categories used in our heuristic eval which is linked above for
            context and the specific violations.
          </p>

          <h3>Navigation between pages</h3>

          <p>
            We didn't do much to change the concern of the search bar being
            confusing (as it just said “Search for …”) since it wasn't intended
            to function as a full search bar in our prototype rather than just a
            placeholder for the concept which would be implemented if the site
            was to actually be built. We added the popular tags categories to
            the map pages to make the function more obvious as a filter. We
            added an additional feature to the logo at the top of the screen to
            go back to the home page since that's something that many sites also
            do and would be relatively easy to understand as a user. We didn't
            add a specific exit button like they requested because we felt that
            many other sites have a similar method to ours where people can
            click off a pop up in order to get rid of it. We also disagreed with
            the idea that the buttons would be the more regular route for site
            usage and felt that concern came from the fact that the search bar
            doesn't function as a search bar in the prototype whereas it would
            on the actual site. The eval also brought up that there weren't many
            shortcuts for expert users so we fleshed out our feed page to be
            something that users could see as a catchall of the interests
            they've curated on the site.
          </p>

          <h3>Pins on the map</h3>

          <p>
            Rather than have different icons to represent events vs people and
            not explain those very well, we chose to change it so that events
            and people are on different pages and used clearer icons like a
            person for a profile and a signup poster for an event. One
            suggestion they made was to use the profile pictures for our pins
            instead of icons and we chose not to implement that because we felt
            it would be visually overwhelming. Since we used only one “pin”
            icon, we felt that resolved any confusion on where to click to get
            more information.
          </p>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>

          <p>
            We chose to address the issues from the heuristic eval about
            instructions by making our website look like a more traditional
            site. They frequently mentioned how having non-standard icons and
            features (like the “PassDoodle”) was confusing and those are things
            we either changed to align with current industry standards or
            removed. We did also change our color palette which helped with
            avoiding using colors like red to signify non-destructive actions.
          </p>

          <h3>Pass-doodle</h3>

          <p>
            We ended up removing this feature entirely as the heuristic evals
            correctly pointed out many fallacies with this system and there
            wasn't a good way to simply fix it. We also added forgot
            password/username buttons to our login page for the traditional
            password.
          </p>

          <h3>Design</h3>

          <p>
            We removed Animan entirely and focused on creating a smaller scoped
            animation (using a person running on our distance filter) to keep
            the playfulness we originally wanted. We also limited our color
            scheme significantly so that there was more consistency across the
            site and it was an easier design on the eyes. We also took the
            consistency piece further and worked to ensure that we maintained a
            few standard design choices across pages. By changing the color
            palette and focusing more on consistency, we made our design a bit
            more formal so it looks more like a tool designed for adults than a
            children's game site. Overall we standardized color and design
            decisions so that the entire site was more cohesive.
          </p>

          <h3>Menu Information</h3>

          <p>
            The primary change we made to our menu information is reducing the
            filters to just the distance filter which is the most important one
            to our site. We did this to reduce the overwhelming amount of
            information we were offering to our users but still have those
            functions via the search bar. If a user wants to search any
            particular filter they're able to do so via the open search bar.
            Since we reduced the number of filters we also no longer needed a
            filter drop down which blocked the search results.
